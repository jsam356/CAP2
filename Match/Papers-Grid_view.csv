Disturbance to human microbiota may underlie several pathologies. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how lifestyle affects the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities.
Results

Here, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of human wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each subjects’ life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, the dynamics of select microbial taxa could be associated with specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake positively correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15% of gut microbiota members.
Conclusions

Our findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.",gb-2014-15-7-r89 (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0472ce82af40ddae2ef4fe455ba66531/bdf98d1a/gb-2014-15-7-r89),16S/ITS Amplicon,DCD,

While it is widely accepted that fluctuations and other types of disturbances can increase biodiversity, there are fewer examples of other types of outcomes in a fluctuating environment. Here we explore this question with laboratory microcosms, using cocultures of two bacterial species, P. putida and P. veronii. At low dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of P. veronii, whereas at high dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of P. putida. When the dilution rate alternates between high and low, we do not observe coexistence between the species, but rather alternative stable states, in which only one species survives and initial species’ fractions determine the identity of the surviving species. The Lotka-Volterra model with a fluctuating mortality rate predicts that this outcome is independent of the timing of the fluctuations, and that the time-averaged mortality would also lead to alternative stable states, a prediction that we confirm experimentally. Other pairs of species can coexist in a fluctuating environment, and again consistent with the model we observe coexistence in the time-averaged dilution rate. We find a similar time-averaging result holds in a three-species community, highlighting that simple linear models can in some cases provide powerful insight into how communities will respond to environmental fluctuations.",journal.pcbi.1007934&type=printable (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8988f4f6b3f5be1c9f9fa94235dc08d8/ea6b03cd/journal.pcbi.1007934typeprintable),Cultures,DCD,

The most promising enzymes were fully characterised and the effects of pH, temperature, amine donor concentration and co-solvent determined. Several enzymes demonstrated good substrate tolerance as well as an unprecedented robustness for a wild-type transaminase. One enzyme in particular readily accepted IPA as an amine donor giving the same conversion with 2–50 equivalents, as well as being tolerant to a number of co-solvents, and operational in up to 50% DMSO – a characteristic as yet unobserved in a wild-type transaminase.

Improving feed efficiency (FE) is important for a more sustainable livestock production. The variability for the efficiency of feed utilization in ruminants is partially controlled by the gastrointestinal microbiota. Modulating the microbiota composition can promote a more sustainable and efficient livestock. This study revealed that most efficient cows had larger relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (P = 0.041) and Prevotella (P = 0.003), while lower, but non-significant (P = 0.119), relative abundance of Firmicutes. Methanobacteria (P = 0.004) and Methanobrevibacter (P = 0.003) were also less abundant in the high-efficiency cows. A de novo metagenome assembly was carried out using de Bruijn graphs in MEGAHIT resulting in 496,375 contigs. An agnostic pre-selection of microbial contigs allowed high classification accuracy for FE and intake levels using hierarchical classification. These microbial contigs were also able to predict FE and intake levels with accuracy of 0.19 and 0.39, respectively, in an independent population (n = 31). Nonetheless, a larger potential accuracy up to 0.69 was foreseen in this study for datasets that allowed a larger statistical power. Enrichment analyses showed that genes within these contigs were mainly involved in fatty acids and cellulose degradation pathways. The findings indicated that there are differences between the microbiota compositions of high and low-efficiency animals both at the taxonomical and gene levels. These differences are even more evident in terms of intake levels. Some of these differences remain even between populations under different diets and environments, and can provide information on the feed utilization performance without information on the individual intake level.",s41598-018-36673-w.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c3af77bc2f9ef9a7b237d4f11437d4b4/65df1415/s41598-018-36673-w.pdf),Metagenomic,DCD,

Although nitrogen fixation in sorghum has been studied since the 1970s, N2-fixing bacteria have not been widely examined in field-grown sorghum plants because the identification of functional diazotrophs depends on the culture method used. The aim of this study was to identify functional N2-fixing bacteria associated with field-grown sorghum by using “omics” approaches. Four lines of sorghum (KM1, KM2, KM4, and KM5) were grown in a field in Fukushima, Japan. The nitrogen-fixing activities of the roots, leaves, and stems were evaluated by acetylene reduction and 15N2-feeding assays. The highest nitrogen-fixing activities were detected in the roots of lines KM1 and KM2 at the late growth stage. Bacterial cells extracted from KM1 and KM2 roots were analyzed by metagenome, proteome, and isolation approaches and their DNA was isolated and sequenced. Nitrogenase structural gene sequences in the metagenome sequences were retrieved using two nitrogenase databases. Most sequences were assigned to nifHDK of Bradyrhizobium species, including non-nodulating Bradyrhizobium sp. S23321 and photosynthetic B. oligotrophicum S58T. Amplicon sequence and metagenome analysis revealed a relatively higher abundance (2.9–3.6%) of Bradyrhizobium in the roots. Proteome analysis indicated that three NifHDK proteins of Bradyrhizobium species were consistently detected across sample replicates. By using oligotrophic media, we purified eight bradyrhizobial isolates. Among them, two bradyrhizobial isolates possessed 16S rRNA and nif genes similar to those in S23321 and S58T which were predicted as functional diazotrophs by omics approaches. Both free-living cells of the isolates expressed N2-fixing activity in a semi-solid medium according to an acetylene reduction assay. These results suggest that major functional N2-fixing bacteria in sorghum roots are unique bradyrhizobia that resemble photosynthetic B. oligotrophicum S58T and non-nodulating Bradyrhizobium sp. S23321. Based on our findings, we discuss the N2-fixing activity level of sorghum plants, phylogenetic and genomic comparison with diazotrophic bacteria in other crops, and Bradyrhizobium diversity in N2 fixation and nodulation.",,16S/ITS Amplicon,DCD,

Calcium-dependent antibiotics are a small family of structurally diverse acidic lipopeptides assembled by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that are known to display various modes of action against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Here we use NRPS adenylation (AD) domain sequencing to guide the identification, recovery, and cloning of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster from a soil metagenome. Heterologous expression of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster led to the production of cadasides A (1) and B (2), a subfamily of acidic lipopeptides that is distinct from previously characterized calcium-dependent antibiotics in terms of both overall structure and acidic residue rich peptide core. The cadasides inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens by disrupting cell wall biosynthesis in the presence of high concentrations of calcium. Interestingly, sequencing of AD domains from diverse soils revealed that sequences predicted to arise from cadaside-like gene clusters are predominantly found in soils containing high levels of calcium carbonate.",,,DCD,

Environmental pressures on plants (wind, dust, drought, water, temperature) vary by geography and characterizing the impact of these variable pressures on phyllosphere microbiota will contribute to improved stewardship of fresh produce for both plant and human health. A higher resolution understanding of the incidence of human pathogens on food plants and co-occurring phytobiota using metagenomic approaches (metagenome tracking) may contribute to improved source attribution and risk assessment in cases where human pathogens become introduced to agro-ecologies. Between 1990 and 2007, as many as 1990 culture-confirmed Salmonella illnesses were linked to tomatoes from as many as 12 multistate outbreaks (Bell et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2014; CDC, 2004; CDC, 2007; Greene et al., 2005a; Gruszynski et al., 2014). When possible, source attribution for these incidents revealed a biogeographic trend, most events were associated with eastern growing regions. To improve our understanding of potential biogeographically linked trends in contamination of tomatoes by Salmonella, we profiled microbiota from the surfaces of tomatoes from Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and California. Bacterial profiles from California tomatoes were completely different than those of Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina (which were highly similar to each other). A statistically significant enrichment of Firmicutes taxa was observed in California phytobiota compared to the three eastern states. Rhizobiaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae and Xanthobacteraceae were the most abundant bacterial families associated with tomatoes grown in eastern states. These baseline metagenomic profiles of phyllosphere microbiota may contribute to improved understanding of how certain ecologies provide supportive resources for human pathogens on plants and how components of certain agro-ecologies may play a role in the introduction of human pathogens to plants.",,16S/ITS Amplicon,DCD,

This study comprises an extensive comparison of geographically distant soil bacterial communities, involving the analysis of 12,850 ribosomal sequence tags from six composite soil samples. Bacterial diversity estimates were greater for undisturbed arctic tundra soil samples than for boreal forest soil samples, with the highest diversity associated with a sample from an extreme northern location (82oN). The lowest diversity estimate was obtained from an arctic soil sample that was disturbed by compaction and sampled from a greater depth. Since samples from the two biomes did not form distinct clusters on the basis of SARST data and DGGE fingerprints, factors other than latitude likely influenced the phylogenetic compositions of these communities. The high number of ribosomal sequences analyzed enabled the identification of possible cosmopolitan and endemic bacterial distributions in particular soils.",,,,

Results: Interproximal-associated microbiota was found to be similar to already described bacterial communities in other mouth niches. Streptoccocus, Veillonella, Rothia, Actinomyces, Neisseria, Haemophilus and Fusobacterium were the most abundant genera in this oral region.

of beneficial bacterium Lactococcus lactis as well as Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, which upregulated galactose metabolism of the microbiome compared with a CHPD.
The CAD also upregulated gene expression involved in obesity associated pathways (e.g., Adipoq and Irs1) in cecal tissue of rats. These genes and the bacterial taxon were reported to play an important role in protecting development of obesity. Furthermore, the differentially represented bacterial taxon L. lactis was positively associated with these differentially expressed genes in the gut tissue. Our results provide a new insight into the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host in response to dietary proteins, indicating a

In extreme cases, such symbiont genomes seem almost unable to sustain the basic cellular functioning, which comprises an open question in the evolution of symbiosis. Here, we report an insect group wherein an ancient symbiont lineage suffering massive genome erosion has experienced recurrent extinction and replacement by host-associated pathogenic microbes. Cicadas are associated with the ancient bacterial co-obligate symbionts Sulcia and Hodgkinia, whose streamlined genomes are specialized for synthesizing essential amino acids, thereby enabling the host to live on plant sap. However, our inspection of 24 Japanese cicada species revealed that while all species possessed Sulcia, only nine species retained Hodgkinia, and their genomes exhibited substantial structural instability. The remaining 15 species lacked Hodgkinia and instead harbored yeast-like fungal symbionts. Detailed phylogenetic analyses uncovered repeated Hodgkinia-fungus and fungus-fungus replacements in cicadas. The fungal symbionts were phylogenetically intermingled with cicada-parasitizing Ophiocordyceps fungi, identifying entomopathogenic origins of the fungal symbionts. Most fungal symbionts of cicadas were uncultivable, but the fungal symbiont of Meimuna opalifera was cultivable, possibly because it is at an early stage of fungal symbiont replacement. Genome sequencing of the fungal symbiont revealed its metabolic versatility, presumably capable of synthesizing almost all amino acids, vitamins, and other metabolites, which is more than sufficient to compensate for the Hodgkinia loss. These findings highlight a straightforward ecological and evolutionary connection between parasitism and symbiosis, which may provide an evolutionary trajectory to renovate deteriorated ancient symbiosis via pathogen domestication.",,Metagenomic,Alleyah Hanson,

The others are in a state of dormancy, with strongly reduced metabolic rates. It is of interest to distinguish active and inactive microbial cells and taxa to understand their functional contributions to ecosystem processes and to understand shifts in microbial activity in response to change. Of the methods used to assess microbial activity-dormancy dynamics, 16S rRNA/rRNA gene amplicons (16S ratios) and active cell staining with 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) are two of the most common, yet each method has limitations. Given that in situ activity-dormancy dynamics are proxied only by laboratory methods, further study is needed to assess the level of agreement and potential complementarity of these methods. We conducted two experiments investigating microbial activity in plant-associated soils. First, we treated corn field soil with phytohormones to simulate plant soil stress signaling, and second, we used rhizosphere soil from common bean plants exposed to drought or nutrient enrichment. Overall, the 16S ratio and CTC methods exhibited similar patterns of relative activity across treatments when treatment effects were large, and the instances in which they differed could be attributed to changes in community size (e.g., cell death or growth). Therefore, regardless of the method used to assess activity, we recommend quantifying community size to inform ecological interpretation. Our results suggest that the 16S ratio and CTC methods report comparable patterns of activity that can be applied to observe ecological dynamics over time, space, or experimental treatment. IMPORTANCE Although the majority of microorganisms in natural ecosystems are dormant, relatively little is known about the dynamics of the active and dormant microbial pools through both space and time. The limited knowledge of microbial activity-dormancy dynamics is in part due to uncertainty in the methods currently used to quantify active taxa. Here, we directly compared two of the most common methods (16S ratios and active cell staining) for estimating microbial activity in plant-associated soil and found that they were largely in agreement in the overarching patterns. Our results suggest that 16S ratios and active cell staining provide complementary information for measuring and interpreting microbial activity-dormancy dynamics in soils. They also support the idea that 16S rRNA/rRNA gene ratios have comparative value and offer a high-throughput, sequencing-based option for understanding relative changes in microbiome activity, as long as this method is coupled with quantification of community size.",,Metagenomic,Alleyah Hanson,

We found that, while the gut microbiota from unweaned infants were simple and showed a high inter-individual variation in taxonomic and gene composition, those from adults and weaned children were more complex but showed a high functional uniformity regardless of age or sex. In searching for the genes over-represented in gut microbiomes, we identified 237 gene families commonly enriched in adult-type and 136 families in infant-type microbiomes, with a small overlap. An analysis of their predicted functions revealed various strategies employed by each type of microbiota to adapt to its intestinal environment, suggesting that these gene sets encode the core functions of adult and infant-type gut microbiota. By analysing the orphan genes, 647 new gene families were identified to be exclusively present in human intestinal microbiomes.

The complex microbiome of the ceca of chickens plays an important role in nutrient utilization, growth and well-being of these animals. Since we have a very limited understanding of the capabilities of most species present in the cecum, we investigated the role of the microbiome by comparative analyses of both the microbial community structure and functional gene content using random sample pyrosequencing. The overall goal of this study was to characterize the chicken cecal microbiome using a pathogen-free chicken and one that had been challenged with Campylobacter jejuni.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Comparative metagenomic pyrosequencing was used to generate 55,364,266 bases of random sampled pyrosequence data from two chicken cecal samples. SSU rDNA gene tags and environmental gene tags (EGTs) were identified using SEED subsystems-based annotations. The distribution of phylotypes and EGTs detected within each cecal sample were primarily from the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, consistent with previous SSU rDNA libraries of the chicken cecum. Carbohydrate metabolism and virulence genes are major components of the EGT content of both of these microbiomes. A comparison of the twelve major pathways in the SEED Virulence Subsystem (metavirulome) represented in the chicken cecum, mouse cecum and human fecal microbiomes showed that the metavirulomes differed between these microbiomes and the metavirulomes clustered by host environment. The chicken cecum microbiomes had the broadest range of EGTs within the SEED Conjugative Transposon Subsystem, however the mouse cecum microbiomes showed a greater abundance of EGTs in this subsystem. Gene assemblies (32 contigs) from one microbiome sample were predominately from the Bacteroidetes, and seven of these showed sequence similarity to transposases, whereas the remaining sequences were most similar to those from catabolic gene families.

Conclusion/Significance
This analysis has demonstrated that mobile DNA elements are a major functional component of cecal microbiomes, thus contributing to horizontal gene transfer and functional microbiome evolution. Moreover, the metavirulomes of these microbiomes appear to associate by host environment. These data have implications for defining core and variable microbiome content in a host species. Furthermore, this suggests that the evolution of host specific metavirulomes is a contributing factor in disease resistance to zoonotic pathogens.",,Metagenomic,Aqib Rahim,

In marine systems, virus-mediated processes can have significant impacts on microbial diversity and on global biogeocehmical cycling. However, viral genetic diversity remains poorly characterized. To address this shortcoming, a metagenomic library was constructed from Chesapeake Bay virioplankton. The resulting sequences constitute the largest collection of long-read double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral metagenome data reported to date. BLAST homology comparisons showed that Chesapeake Bay virioplankton contained a high proportion of unknown (homologous only to environmental sequences) and novel (no significant homolog) sequences. This analysis suggests that dsDNA viruses are likely one of the largest reservoirs of unknown genetic diversity in the biosphere. The taxonomic origin of BLAST homologs to viral library sequences agreed well with reported abundances of cooccurring bacterial subphyla within the estuary and indicated that cyanophages were abundant. However, the low proportion of Siphophage homologs contradicts a previous assertion that this family comprises most bacteriophage diversity. Identification and analyses of cyanobacterial homologs of the psbA gene illustrated the value of metagenomic studies of virioplankton. The phylogeny of inferred PsbA protein sequences suggested that Chesapeake Bay cyanophage strains are endemic in that environment. The ratio of psbA homologous sequences to total cyanophage sequences in the metagenome indicated that the psbA gene may be nearly universal in Chesapeake Bay cyanophage genomes. Furthermore, the low frequency of psbD homologs in the library supports the prediction that Chesapeake Bay cyanophage populations are dominated by Podoviridae.

Viruses are the most numerically abundant biological entities in marine ecosystems (9, 49, 62), and the ecological importance of marine viruses is supported by a growing body of research (for reviews, see references 61, 67, and 73). Viruses are an important component of the marine microbial loop (7, 12, 30, 62, 69), and it is likely that all members of marine microbial communities (protists, microalgae, and prokaryotes) are prone to viral infection (17). Marine viral lysis impacts global carbon cycles by enhancing dissolved organic matter recycling, decreasing transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels, and exporting particulate organic carbon from the photic zone (30, 41, 42, 61). For example, viruses can significantly influence concentrations of micronutrients, such as iron, by cell lysis (47) or by acting as nucleation centers for iron adsorption and precipitation (26).

In addition to direct impacts on ocean biogeochemistry, the viral infection process may significantly alter the structure of microbial host communities. Virus-mediated changes in community genetic diversity are induced by selective infection and lysis of abundant community members (45, 63). Thus, host-selective viral infection may increase the overall clonal diversity of microbial host populations by removing numerically dominant community members from particular niches. Viruses, particularly bacteriophages, can also directly alter the phenotypes of host cells through genetic exchange (specific and generalized transduction) (44) or through the cryptic infectious state known as lysogeny (50), which has been observed in many marine ecosystems, especially under conditions which are unfavorable for host growth (40, 70). Because viral nucleic acids are incorporated into the host genome, lysogeny can lead to phage-mediated phenotypic conversion of prokaryotic hosts (44, 50).

The effects of viral infection in marine ecosystems emerge from the collective phage-host interactions in marine microbial communities. However, with the exception of a few well-known bacteriophages (e.g., T4, T7, λ, and P20), relatively little is known about the genetic capabilities and phenotypic characteristics of the vast majority of viruses. Whole-genome sequence data for a small collection of marine bacteriophage-host systems have revealed that the phages carry an unusually high proportion of unknown genes and have previously unexpected gene functions, such as involvement in phosphate uptake (e.g., phoH in Roseophage SIO1) (53) and photosynthesis (e.g., psbA in marine cyanophage) (38, 58, 59). Genomic investigations of phycoviruses have also revealed a high proportion of unknown genes and unusual functional genes, such as genes involved in the induction of apoptosis (71). Although investigations of single phage-host systems have provided unparalleled insights into these interactions, a broader understanding of virioplankton composition and diversity can come only from cultivation-independent approaches.

Characterization of whole viral assemblages based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has indicated that marine virioplankton community diversity varies dynamically in response to both seasonal and spatial gradients in ecosystem properties (74, 75) and that these changes mirror those in host bacterial communities (33). Higher-resolution surveys using marker genes (e.g., g20 and DNA polymerase genes) within specific lineages of virioplankton have uncovered extraordinary diversity (23, 77), yet some viral strains have been found in nearly all marine environments (15, 56, 57). While PFGE and marker genotyping approaches have been critical in the development of a foundation for synecological studies of virioplankton, they are limited either in resolution (PFGE) or breadth (marker genotyping).

Characterization of microbial communities using high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatic approaches (i.e., metagenomics) addresses some of the limitations of these approaches and provides a high-resolution view of microbial diversity, as well as the potential functional capabilities within these assemblages. Based on the few metagenome surveys of marine viral communities completed to date, a consensus is emerging that virioplankton communities are extraordinarily diverse and contain a high proportion of unknown sequences (27). Against the typical backdrop of over 60% unknown sequences, viral metagenome libraries tend to contain a collection of gene homologs that are relatively distant from better-known representatives in bacterial genomes (13, 16). Despite the predisposition for horizontal gene transfer between bacteriophage genomes (32), there appears to be a specific “marine” aspect to virioplankton assemblages, which are dominated by genes from marine phages and cyanophages in particular (6). Analyses of a large database of short-read (∼100-base) sequences from four oceanic regions estimated that the compositions of virioplankton assemblages were extraordinarily even, that the assemblages contained between 500 and 130,000 genotypes, and that there were significant overlaps in genotype composition between disparate geographic regions (6).

While viral communities in near-shore waters, sediments, and open oceans have been examined (6, 13, 16), the genomes of virioplankton in a highly productive estuarine ecosystem have not been described in detail. Previous investigations characterizing bacterioplankton diversity demonstrated that the variable estuarine environment selects for a unique bacterioplankton assemblage whose composition is temporally and spatially dynamic (25, 34). The earliest demonstrations that virioplankton exhibit seasonally dynamic patterns of abundance (72), diversity, and composition (74, 75) were obtained from studies of the Chesapeake Bay.

As such, it provides a unique genetic resource for plant cell wall degrading microbial enzymes that could be used in the production of biofuels. The rumen and gastrointestinal tract harbor a dense and complex microbiome. To gain a greater understanding of the ecology and metabolic potential of this microbiome, we used comparative metagenomics (phylotype analysis and SEED subsystems-based annotations) to examine randomly sampled pyrosequence data from 3 fiber-adherent microbiomes and 1 pooled liquid sample (a mixture of the liquid microbiome fractions from the same bovine rumens). Even though the 3 animals were fed the same diet, the community structure, predicted phylotype, and metabolic potentials in the rumen were markedly different with respect to nutrient utilization. A comparison of the glycoside hydrolase and cellulosome functional genes revealed that in the rumen microbiome, initial colonization of fiber appears to be by organisms possessing enzymes that attack the easily available side chains of complex plant polysaccharides and not the more recalcitrant main chains, especially cellulose. Furthermore, when compared with the termite hindgut microbiome, there are fundamental differences in the glycoside hydrolase content that appear to be diet driven for either the bovine rumen (forages and legumes) or the termite hindgut (wood).",,Metagenomic,Aqib Rahim,

Here, we describe the characterization of these extinct hominids from a new perspective, based on the development of a Neanderthal metagenomic library and its high-throughput sequencing and analysis. Several lines of evidence indicate that the 65,250 base pairs of hominid sequence so far identified in the library are of Neanderthal origin, the strongest being the ascertainment of sequence identities between Neanderthal and chimpanzee at sites where the human genomic sequence is different. These results enabled us to calculate the human-Neanderthal divergence time based on multiple randomly distributed autosomal loci. Our analyses suggest that on average the Neanderthal genomic sequence we obtained and the reference human genome sequence share a most recent common ancestor approximately 706,000 years ago, and that the human and Neanderthal ancestral populations split approximately 370,000 years ago, before the emergence of anatomically modern humans. Our finding that the Neanderthal and human genomes are at least 99.5% identical led us to develop and successfully implement a targeted method for recovering specific ancient DNA sequences from metagenomic libraries.

Here we use experimental metagenomics to show that coastal communities are populated by taxa capable of metabolizing a wide variety of organic carbon compounds. Genomic DNA captured from bacterial community subsets metabolizing a single model component of the DOC pool (either dimethylsulphoniopropionate or vanillate) showed substantial overlap in gene composition as well as a diversity of carbon-processing capabilities beyond the selected phenotypes. Our direct measure of niche breadth for bacterial functional assemblages indicates that, in accordance with ecological theory, heterogeneity in the composition and supply of organic carbon to coastal oceans may favour generalist bacteria. In the important interplay between microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycling, coastal heterotrophic communities may be controlled less by transient changes in the carbon reservoir that they process and more by factors such as trophic interactions and physical conditions.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Metagenomics is emerging as a powerful method to study the function and physiology of the unexplored microbial biosphere, and is causing us to re-evaluate basic precepts of microbial ecology and evolution. Most marine metagenomic analyses have been nearly exclusively devoted to photic waters.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We constructed a metagenomic fosmid library from 3,000 m-deep Mediterranean plankton, which is much warmer (∼14°C) than waters of similar depth in open oceans (∼2°C). We analyzed the library both by phylogenetic screening based on 16S rRNA gene amplification from clone pools and by sequencing both insert extremities of ca. 5,000 fosmids. Genome recruitment strategies showed that the majority of high scoring pairs corresponded to genomes from Rhizobiales within the Alphaproteobacteria, Cenarchaeum symbiosum, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Gammaproteobacteria. We have found a community structure similar to that found in the aphotic zone of the Pacific. However, the similarities were significantly higher to the mesopelagic (500–700 m deep) in the Pacific than to the single 4000 m deep sample studied at this location. Metabolic genes were mostly related to catabolism, transport and degradation of complex organic molecules, in agreement with a prevalent heterotrophic lifestyle for deep-sea microbes. However, we observed a high percentage of genes encoding dehydrogenases and, among them, cox genes, suggesting that aerobic carbon monoxide oxidation may be important in the deep ocean as an additional energy source.

Conclusions/Significance
The comparison of metagenomic libraries from the deep Mediterranean and the Pacific ALOHA water column showed that bathypelagic Mediterranean communities resemble more mesopelagic communities in the Pacific, and suggests that, in the absence of light, temperature is a major stratifying factor in the oceanic water column, overriding pressure at least over 4000 m deep. Several chemolithotrophic metabolic pathways could supplement organic matter degradation in this most depleted habitat.",journal_pone_0000914.PDF (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c204e76099d670ecd19267530ee67bc4/d3f8964c/journal_pone_0000914.PDF),Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

We furthermore show that substitutions resulting from miscoding cytosine residues are vastly overrepresented in the DNA sequences and drastically clustered in the ends of the molecules, whereas other substitutions are rare. We present a model where the observed substitution patterns are used to estimate the rate of deamination of cytosine residues in single- and double-stranded portions of the DNA, the length of single-stranded ends, and the frequency of nicks.

We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A total of 3,995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are identified, out of which 1,700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin, thus reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in the GOS dataset and current protein databases show distinct biases. Several protein domains that were previously categorized as kingdom specific are shown to have GOS examples in other kingdoms. About 6,000 sequences (ORFans) from the literature that heretofore lacked similarity to known proteins have matches in the GOS data. The GOS dataset is also used to improve remote homology detection. Overall, besides nearly doubling the number of current proteins, the predicted GOS proteins also add a great deal of diversity to known protein families and shed light on their evolution. These observations are illustrated using several protein families, including phosphatases, proteases, ultraviolet-irradiation DNA damage repair enzymes, glutamine synthetase, and RuBisCO. The diversity added by GOS data has implications for choosing targets for experimental structure characterization as part of structural genomics efforts. Our analysis indicates that new families are being discovered at a rate that is linear or almost linear with the addition of new sequences, implying that we are still far from discovering all protein families in nature.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

From each study site, three composed soil samples were collected for chemical, physical, and metagenomics analysis. We used a paired-end library sequencing technology (NextSeq 500 Illumina); the reads were assembled using MEGAHIT. Coding DNA sequences (CDS) were identified using Kaiju in combination with non-redundant NCBI BLAST reference sequences containing archaea, bacteria, and viruses. Additionally, a functional classification was performed by EMG v2.3.2. Here, we provide the raw data and assembly (reads and contigs), followed by initial functional and taxonomic analysis, as a base-line for further studies of this kind.

Despite its significance, the biological mechanisms controlling anaerobic methane oxidation are not well characterized. One current model suggests that relatives of methane-producing Archaea developed the capacity to reverse methanogenesis and thereby to consume methane to produce cellular carbon and energy. We report here a test of the ""reverse-methanogenesis"" hypothesis by genomic analyses of methane-oxidizing Archaea from deep-sea sediments. Our results show that nearly all genes typically associated with methane production are present in one specific group of archaeal methanotrophs.

Here, we harness the sampling power of the western honey bee, a generalist pollinator whose diet breadth overlaps substantially with that of other pollinators, to survey the utilization of ornamental plants grown at three commercial nurseries in Connecticut, USA. Using a combination of DNA metabarcoding and microscopy, we identify, to genus-level, pollen samples from honey bee colonies placed within each nursery, and we compare our results with nursery plant inventories to identify the subset of cultivated genera that were visited during pollen foraging. Samples were collected weekly from May to September, encompassing the majority of the growing season. Our findings show that some plant genera known to be cultivated as ornamentals in our system, particularly ornamental trees and shrubs (e.g. Hydrangea, Rosa, Spiraea, Syringa, Viburnum), functioned as major pollen sources, but the majority of plants inventoried at our nurseries provided little or no pollen to honey bees.

Studying flower–insect relationships at the scale of communities and landscapes has been hindered, however, by the methodological challenges of quantifying landscape‐scale floral resources. This challenge is especially acute in urban landscapes, where traditional floral surveying techniques are ill‐suited to the unique constraints of built environments. To surmount these challenges, we devised a “honey bee foraging assay” approach to floral resource surveying, wherein continuous colony weight tracking and DNA metabarcoding of pollen samples are used to capture both the overall availability and taxonomic composition of floral resources. We deploy this methodology in the complex urban ecosystem of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Our results reveal distinct seasonality of floral resource availability, with pulses of high availability in May, June, and September, and a period of prolonged scarcity in August. Pollen genus richness mirrored this pattern, with peak richness in May and June. The taxonomic composition of pollen samples varied seasonally, reflecting underlying floral phenology, with especially strong turnover between May and June samples and between August and September samples delineating well‐defined spring, summer, and fall floral resource communities. Trait analysis also revealed seasonal structure, with spring samples characterized by trees and shrubs, summer samples including a stronger presence of herbaceous “weeds”, and fall samples dominated by woody vines. Native flora predominated in spring, giving way to a preponderance of exotic flora in summer and fall. At a basic level, this yields insight into the assembly of novel urban floral resource communities, showcasing, for example, the emergence of a woody vine‐dominated fall flora. At an applied level, our data can inform urban land management, such as the design of ecologically functional ornamental plantings, while also providing practical guidance to beekeepers seeking to adapt their management activities to floral resource seasonality. Methodologically, our study demonstrates the potential of the honey bee foraging assay as a powerful technique for landscape‐scale floral resource surveying, provided the inherent biases of honey bee foraging are accounted for in the interpretation of the results.",ecs2_3102.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e94548947720bc4f8c94dc1ab83470b2/8526eb6d/ecs2_3102.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

In order to track uncultivated microbial genotypes and their close relatives in an environmental context, we designed and implemented a 'genome-proxy' microarray that targets microbial genome fragments recovered directly from the environment. Fragments consisted of sequenced clones from large-insert genomic libraries from microbial communities in Monterey Bay, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA, and Antarctic coastal waters. In a prototype array, we designed probe sets to 13 of the sequenced genome fragments and to genomic regions of the cultivated cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4. Each probe set consisted of multiple 70-mers, each targeting an individual open reading frame, and distributed along each approximately 40-160 kbp contiguous genomic region. The targeted organisms or clones, and close relatives, were hybridized to the array both as pure DNA mixtures and as additions of cells to a background of coastal seawater. This prototype array correctly identified the presence or absence of the target organisms and their relatives in laboratory mixes, with negligible cross-hybridization to organisms having <or= approximately 75% genomic identity. In addition, the array correctly identified target cells added to a background of environmental DNA, with a limit of detection of approximately 0.1% of the community, corresponding to approximately 10(3) cells ml(-1) in these samples. Signal correlated to cell concentration with an R(2) of 1.0 across six orders of magnitude. In addition, the array could track a related strain (at 86% genomic identity to that targeted) with a linearity of R(2) = 0.9999 and a limit of detection of approximately 1% of the community. Closely related genotypes were distinguishable by differing hybridization patterns across each probe set. This array's multiple-probe, 'genome-proxy' approach and consequent ability to track both target genotypes and their close relatives is important for the array's environmental application given the recent discoveries of considerable intrapopulation diversity within marine microbial communities.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Methodology/principal findings: Comparative metagenomic pyrosequencing was used to generate 55,364,266 bases of random sampled pyrosequence data from two chicken cecal samples.

To investigate temperate phage gene expression, an induced viral metagenome from Tampa Bay was sequenced by 454/Pyrosequencing. The sequencing yielded 294,068 reads with 6.6% identifiable. One hundred-three sequences had significant similarity to integrases by BLASTX analysis (e≤0.001). Four sequences with strongest amino-acid level similarity to integrases were selected and real-time PCR primers and probes were designed. Initial testing with microbial fraction DNA from Tampa Bay revealed 1.9×107, and 1300 gene copies of Vibrio-like integrase and Oceanicola-like integrase L−1 respectively. The other two integrases were not detected. The integrase assay was then tested on microbial fraction RNA extracted from 200 ml of Tampa Bay water sampled biweekly over a 12 month time series. Vibrio-like integrase gene expression was detected in three samples, with estimated copy numbers of 2.4-1280 L−1. Clostridium-like integrase gene expression was detected in 6 samples, with estimated copy numbers of 37 to 265 L−1. In all cases, detection of integrase gene expression corresponded to the occurrence of lysogeny as detected by prophage induction. Investigation of the environmental distribution of the two expressed integrases in the Global Ocean Survey Database found the Vibrio-like integrase was present in genome equivalents of 3.14% of microbial libraries and all four viral metagenomes. There were two similar genes in the library from British Columbia and one similar gene was detected in both the Gulf of Mexico and Sargasso Sea libraries. In contrast, in the Arctic library eleven similar genes were observed. The Clostridium-like integrase was less prevalent, being found in 0.58% of the microbial and none of the viral libraries.

Methods: In the current study, we assessed the gut microbiota profiling of apoE KO mice and compared with wild-type mice fed either a normal chow or Western diet for 12 weeks using 16S pyrosequencing.

Results: On a western diet, the gut microbiota diversity was significantly decreased in apoE KO mice compared with wild type (WT) mice. Firmicutes and Erysipelotrichaceae were significantly increased in WT mice but Erysipelotrichaceae was unchanged in apoE KO mice on a Western diet.

Lachnospiraceae was significantly enriched in apoE KO mice on a Western diet. In addition, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with relative atherosclerosis lesion size in apoE KO.

Moreover, the dataset points towards downstream electron‐accepting redox components different from the ones known from methanogenic archaea. Whereas catalytic subunits of [NiFe]‐hydrogenases are lacking in the dataset, genes for an [FeFe]‐hydrogenase homologue were identified, not yet described to be present in methanogenic archaea. Clustered genes annotated as secreted multiheme c ‐type cytochromes were identified, which have not yet been correlated with methanogenesis‐related steps.

Using newly designed degenerate primers targeting the phnA gene we analysed the potential for phosphonoacetate utilization in DNA and cDNA libraries constructed from a phytoplankton bloom in the Western English Channel during July 2006. Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed and phosphonoacetate hydrolase (phnA ) transcripts were PCR amplified from the cDNA with the degenerate primers, cloned and sequenced.

The Arctic and Antarctic are the two most geographically distant bioregions on earth. Recent sampling efforts and following metagenomics have shed light on the global ocean microbial diversity and function, yet the microbiota of polar regions has not been included in such global analyses.

Results
Here a metagenomic study of seawater samples (n = 60) collected from different depths at 28 locations in the Arctic and Antarctic zones was performed, together with metagenomes from the Tara Oceans. More than 7500 (19%) polar seawater-derived operational taxonomic units could not be identified in the Tara Oceans datasets, and more than 3,900,000 protein-coding gene orthologs had no hits in the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog. Analysis of 214 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from the polar seawater microbiomes, revealed strains that are prevalent in the polar regions while nearly undetectable in temperate seawater. Metabolic pathway reconstruction for these microbes suggested versatility for saccharide and lipids biosynthesis, nitrate and sulfate reduction, and CO2 fixation. Comparison between the Arctic and Antarctic microbiomes revealed that antibiotic resistance genes were enriched in the Arctic while functions like DNA recombination were enriched in the Antarctic.

Conclusions
Our data highlight the occurrence of dominant and locally enriched microbes in the Arctic and Antarctic seawater with unique functional traits for environmental adaption, and provide a foundation for analyzing the global ocean microbiome in a more complete perspective.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Deep Sequencing of a Dimethylsulfoniopropionate-Degrading Gene (dmdA) by Using PCR Primer Pairs Designed on the Basis of Marine Metagenomic Data,PRJNA29039,16/11/2009,"Vanessa A.

Howard, Shulei Sun, Mary Ann Moran",Applied and Environmental Microbiology,"Sequence Classification,DNA,Developmental Biology",https://aem.asm.org/content/76/2/609,,"In silico design and testing of environmental primer pairs with metagenomic data are beneficial for capturing a greater proportion of the natural sequence heterogeneity in microbial functional genes, as well as for understanding limitations of existing primer sets that were designed from more restricted sequence data. PCR primer pairs targeting 10 environmental clades and subclades of the dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) demethylase protein, DmdA, were designed using an iterative bioinformatic approach that took advantage of thousands of dmdA sequences captured in marine metagenomic data sets. Using the bioinformatically optimized primers, dmdA genes were amplified from composite free-living coastal bacterioplankton DNA (from 38 samples over 5 years and two locations) and sequenced using 454 technology. An average of 6,400 amplicons per primer pair represented more than 700 clusters of environmental dmdA sequences across all primers, with clusters defined conservatively at >90% nucleotide sequence identity (∼95% amino acid identity). Degenerate and inosine-based primers did not perform better than specific primer pairs in determining dmdA richness and sometimes captured a lower degree of richness of sequences from the same DNA sample. A comparison of dmdA sequences in free-living versus particle-associated bacteria in southeastern U.S. coastal waters showed that sequence richness in some dmdA subgroups differed significantly between size fractions, though most gene clusters were shared (52 to 91%) and most sequences were affiliated with the shared clusters (∼90%). The availability of metagenomic sequence data has significantly enhanced the design of quantitative PCR primer pairs for this key functional gene, providing robust access to the capabilities and activities of DMSP demethylating bacteria in situ.

Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is an abundant organic sulfur compound produced by marine phytoplankton as an osmolyte and for antioxidant purposes (5, 19, 27, 34, 36, 38). Upon cell lysis, DMSP and its degradation products are released into the surrounding seawater, thus providing bacterial communities with reduced organic carbon and sulfur (20) as well as contributing significantly to ocean-atmosphere sulfur flux (1, 24). Marine organisms capable of DMSP degradation can use either of two environmentally significant pathways. One route, known as the cleavage pathway, can lead to degassing of DMSP-derived sulfur from surface waters in the form of dimethylsulfide (DMS), an important catalyst in cloud formation. The second, a bacterium-specific route known as the demethylation pathway, results in DMSP-derived sulfur compounds (such as methylmercaptopropionate [MMPA] and methanethiol [MeSH]) that typically remain within the marine microbial food web. Studies show that certain groups of bacteria can mediate either or both competing pathways (11, 35), although the predominant route of DMSP degradation is through demethylation (18, 20, 21). Significant biogeochemical data for bacterially mediated DMSP flux are now available (21, 33) and have allowed us to establish a framework for understanding this process in the marine environment (32). Yet the underlying genetic basis by which bacterioplankton perform and regulate these globally important sulfur transformations is relatively unknown.

The identification of dmdA (15), the gene encoding a DMSP demethylase that mediates the first step in the demethylation pathway, provides a key genetic tool for understanding the fate of DMSP in ocean waters. dmdA is highly abundant in marine metagenomic data sets, with thousands of homologs (15, 16) identified in the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) Sargasso Sea (37) and 2007 GOS (29) data sets. These findings indicate an important ecological role for dmdA in natural bacterioplankton communities. Two pressing areas for gene-based research include characterizing the diversity, abundance, and distribution of demethylating bacteria in the marine environment and determining how bacterial communities regulate DMSP fate via demethylation.

Here we describe our strategy for designing and testing dmdA primers to study the diversity of DMSP demethylating bacterial genes in marine environments. We took advantage of the non-PCR-amplified dmdA homolog sequence reads identified in the 2007 GOS release to design universal and clade-specific primer pairs for dmdA sequences. An in silico primer-testing pipeline checked specificity against metagenomic reads and identified mismatches to iteratively improve primer design.

However, only 15 SAR11 phages have been isolated thus far, and only one of them belongs to the Myoviridae family (pelagimyophages). Here, we have analyzed 26 sequences of myophages that putatively infect the SAR11 clade. They have been retrieved by mining ca. 45 Gbp aquatic assembled cellular metagenomes and viromes. Most of the myophages were obtained from the cellular fraction (0.2 μm), indicating a bias against this type of virus in viromes. We have found the first myophages that putatively infect Candidatus Fonsibacter (freshwater SAR11) and another group putatively infecting bathypelagic SAR11 phylogroup Ic. The genomes have similar sizes and maintain overall synteny in spite of low average nucleotide identity values, revealing high similarity to marine cyanomyophages. Pelagimyophages recruited metagenomic reads widely from several locations but always much more from cellular metagenomes than from viromes, opposite to what happens with pelagipodophages. Comparing the genomes resulted in the identification of a hypervariable island that is related to host recognition. Interestingly, some genes in these islands could be related to host cell wall synthesis and coinfection avoidance. A cluster of curli-related proteins was widespread among the genomes, although its function is unclear.

IMPORTANCE SAR11 clade members are among the most abundant bacteria on Earth. Their study is complicated by their great diversity and difficulties in being grown and manipulated in the laboratory. On the other hand, and due to their extraordinary abundance, metagenomic data sets provide enormous richness of information about these microbes. Given the major role played by phages in the lifestyle and evolution of prokaryotic cells, the contribution of several new bacteriophage genomes preying on this clade opens windows into the infection strategies and life cycle of its viruses. Such strategies could provide models of attack of large-genome phages preying on streamlined aquatic microbes.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

With genome sequencing becoming more and more affordable, environmental shotgun sequencing of the microorganisms present in an environment generates a challenging amount of sequence data for the scientific community. These sequence data enable the diversity of the microbial world and the metabolic pathways within an environment to be investigated, a previously unthinkable achievement when using traditional approaches. DNA sequence data assembled from extracts of 0.8 μm filtered Sargasso seawater unveiled an unprecedented glimpse of marine prokaryotic diversity and gene content. Serendipitously, many sequences representing picoeukaryotes (cell size <2 μm) were also present within this dataset. We investigated the picoeukaryotic diversity of this database by searching sequences containing homologs of eight nuclear anchor genes that are well conserved throughout the eukaryotic lineage, as well as one chloroplastic and one mitochondrial gene.

Results
We found up to 41 distinct eukaryotic scaffolds, with a broad phylogenetic spread on the eukaryotic tree of life. The average eukaryotic scaffold size is 2,909 bp, with one gap every 1,253 bp. Strikingly, the AT frequency of the eukaryotic sequences (51.4%) is significantly lower than the average AT frequency of the metagenome (61.4%). This represents 4% to 18% of the estimated prokaryotic diversity, depending on the average prokaryotic versus eukaryotic genome size ratio.

Conclusion
Despite similar cell size, eukaryotic sequences of the Sargasso Sea metagenome have higher GC content, suggesting that different environmental pressures affect the evolution of their base composition.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Our research aimed to characterize the genes and organisms from two different WWTPs that discharge into Lake Michigan, as well as from surrounding lake sediments to determine the dispersal and fate of these factors with respect to distance from the effluent outfall. Shotgun metagenomics coupled to distance-decay analyses showed a higher abundance of genes identical to those in WWTP effluent genes in sediments closer to outfall sites than in sediments farther away, indicating their possible WWTP origin. We also found genes attributed to organisms, such as those belonging to Helicobacteraceae, Legionellaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Neisseriaceae, in effluent from both WWTPs and decreasing in abundance in lake sediments with increased distance from WWTPs. Moreover, our results showed that the WWTPs likely influence the ARG composition in lake sediments close to the effluent discharge. Many of these ARGs were located on MGEs in both the effluent and sediment samples, indicating a relatively broad propensity for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Our approach allowed us to specifically link genes to organisms and their genetic context, providing insight into WWTP impacts on natural microbial communities. Overall, our results suggest a substantial influence of wastewater effluent on gene content and microbial community structure in the sediments of receiving water bodies.

IMPORTANCE Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) release their effluent into aquatic environments. Although treated, effluent retains many genes and microorganisms that have the potential to influence the receiving water in ways that are poorly understood. Here, we tracked the genetic footprint, including genes specific to antibiotic resistance and mobile genetic elements and their associated organisms, from WWTPs to lake sediments. Our work is novel in that we used metagenomic data sets to comprehensively evaluate total gene content and the genetic and taxonomic context of specific genes in environmental samples putatively impacted by WWTP inputs. Based on two different WWTPs with different treatment processes, our findings point to an influence of WWTPs on the presence, abundance, and composition of these factors in the environment.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Analyses of DNA sequences from cultivated microorganisms have revealed genome-wide, taxa-specific nucleotide compositional characteristics, referred to as genome signatures. These signatures have far-reaching implications for understanding genome evolution and potential application in classification of metagenomic sequence fragments. However, little is known regarding the distribution of genome signatures in natural microbial communities or the extent to which environmental factors shape them.

Results
We analyzed metagenomic sequence data from two acidophilic biofilm communities, including composite genomes reconstructed for nine archaea, three bacteria, and numerous associated viruses, as well as thousands of unassigned fragments from strain variants and low-abundance organisms. Genome signatures, in the form of tetranucleotide frequencies analyzed by emergent self-organizing maps, segregated sequences from all known populations sharing < 50 to 60% average amino acid identity and revealed previously unknown genomic clusters corresponding to low-abundance organisms and a putative plasmid. Signatures were pervasive genome-wide. Clusters were resolved because intra-genome differences resulting from translational selection or protein adaptation to the intracellular (pH ~5) versus extracellular (pH ~1) environment were small relative to inter-genome differences. We found that these genome signatures stem from multiple influences but are primarily manifested through codon composition, which we propose is the result of genome-specific mutational biases.

Conclusions
An important conclusion is that shared environmental pressures and interactions among coevolving organisms do not obscure genome signatures in acid mine drainage communities. Thus, genome signatures can be used to assign sequence fragments to populations, an essential prerequisite if metagenomics is to provide ecological and biochemical insights into the functioning of microbial communities.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

In this study, we used sequence data obtained from the dominant member of a low-diversity natural chemoautotrophic microbial community to determine how coexisting closely related individuals differ from each other in terms of gene sequence and gene content, and to uncover evidence of evolutionary processes that occur over short timescales. DNA sequence obtained from an acid mine drainage biofilm was reconstructed, taking into account the effects of strain variation, to generate a nearly complete genome tiling path for a Leptospirillum group II species closely related to L. ferriphilum (sampling depth ∼20×). The population is dominated by one sequence type, yet we detected evidence for relatively abundant variants (>99.5% sequence identity to the dominant type) at multiple loci, and a few rare variants. Blocks of other Leptospirillum group II types (∼94% sequence identity) have recombined into one or more variants. Variant blocks of both types are more numerous near the origin of replication. Heterogeneity in genetic potential within the population arises from localized variation in gene content, typically focused in integrated plasmid/phage-like regions. Some laterally transferred gene blocks encode physiologically important genes, including quorum-sensing genes of the LuxIR system. Overall, results suggest inter- and intrapopulation genetic exchange involving distinct parental genome types and implicate gain and loss of phage and plasmid genes in recent evolution of this Leptospirillum group II population. Population genetic analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate variation between closely related strains is not maintained by positive selection, suggesting that these regions do not represent adaptive differences between strains. Thus, the most likely explanation for the observed patterns of polymorphism is divergence of ancestral strains due to geographic isolation, followed by mixing and subsequent recombination.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that integrates the gut and central nervous system (CNS) activities. The changes in chemical signaling, metabolism and gut microbiota associated with Mn exposure have provided deeper insight into the neurotoxic mechanism of Mn. We observed that Mn exposure increases host manganic bioaccumulation, and β-amyloid (Aβ), receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) and caspase-3 production in the brain, and causes hippocampal degeneration and necrosis. Mn exposure led to decreased gut bacterial richness, especially for Prevotellaceae, Fusobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae.

phenotypic, and cultural diversity. We integrate gut microbiome 16S rRNA amplicon
and shotgun metagenomic sequence data with quantification of pathogen burden
and measures of immune parameters for 575 ethnically diverse Africans from
Cameroon. Subjects followed pastoralist, agropastoralist, and hunter-gatherer
lifestyles and were compared to an urban US population from Philadelphia.
Results: We observe significant differences in gut microbiome composition across
populations that correlate with subsistence strategy and country. After these, the
variable most strongly associated with gut microbiome structure in Cameroonians is
the presence of gut parasites. Hunter-gatherers have high frequencies of parasites
relative to agropastoralists and pastoralists. Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus,
Trichuris trichiura, and Strongyloides stercoralis soil-transmitted helminths (“ANTS”
parasites) significantly co-occur, and increased frequency of gut parasites correlates
with increased gut microbial diversity. Gut microbiome composition predicts ANTS
positivity with 80% accuracy. Colonization with ANTS, in turn, is associated with
elevated levels of TH1, TH2, and proinflammatory cytokines, indicating an association
with multiple immune mechanisms. The unprecedented size of this dataset allowed
interrogation of additional questions—for example, we find that Fulani pastoralists,
who consume high levels of milk, possess an enrichment of gut bacteria that
catabolize galactose, an end product of lactose metabolism, and of bacteria that
metabolize lipids.
Conclusions: These data document associations of bacterial microbiota and
eukaryotic parasites with each other and with host immune responses; each of these
is further correlated with subsistence practices.",s13059-020-02020-4.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c65e46c511027c2b2f9ac2036a87714a/ef570e72/s13059-020-02020-4.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

Factors that influence human vaginal microbiota composition, including its source, are not well understood.

Objective The goal of this study was to determine if vaginal microbiota transmission from mother to daughter at birth influences the human vaginal microbiota composition in adolescence.

Study Design Weekly vaginal swab samples from 13 adolescents and their mothers were collected for up to 4 weeks. After DNA was isolated from the swabs, the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. We calculated distances between the bacterial communities in different samples to investigate the relationship between the vaginal microbiota of the mother/daughter pairs and the daughter’s birth mode. We also cultivated Lactobacillus crispatus from the mother and daughter of 1 pair. To investigate the possibility of direct transmission and persistence of one member of the vaginal microbiota, we isolated DNA from the L. crispatus isolates and compared their genomes with each other and other publicly available L. crispatus genome sequences.

Results The vaginal microbiotas of mother/daughter pairs were more similar to each other if the daughter was born by vaginal delivery rather than by C-section. Additionally, genome sequences from an important member of the vaginal microbiota, L. crispatus, isolated from one mother/daughter pair in which the daughter was born by vaginal delivery, were highly similar.

Conclusion Both community-level analysis and isolate genome sequence analysis are consistent with birth-mode dependent transmission and persistence of at least some members of the vaginal microbiota.

However, the multitude of host and environmental factors that influence the microbiome are still largely unknown. Here, we examined UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (Galnt3)-deficient mice, which serve as a model for the disease hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC). In HFTC, loss of GALNT3 activity in the bone is thought to lead to altered glycosylation of the phosphate-regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), resulting in hyperphosphatemia and subdermal calcified tumors. However, GALNT3 is expressed in other tissues in addition to bone, suggesting that systemic loss could result in other pathologies. Using semiquantitative real-time PCR, we found that Galnt3 is the major O-glycosyltransferase expressed in the secretory cells of salivary glands. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the loss of Galnt3 resulted in changes in the structure, composition, and stability of the oral microbiome. Moreover, we identified the major secreted salivary mucin, Muc10, as an in vivo substrate of Galnt3. Given that mucins and their O-glycans are known to interact with various microbes, our results suggest that loss of Galnt3 decreases glycosylation of Muc10, which alters the composition and stability of the oral microbiome. Considering that oral findings have been documented in HFTC patients, our study suggests that investigating GALNT3-mediated changes in the oral microbiome may be warranted.",,,Suraj Patel,

Neural stimulation has shown potential as a treatment for genital arousal FSD, however the mechanisms for its improvement are unknown. One potential cause of some cases of genital arousal FSD are changes to the composition of the vaginal microbiota, which is associated with vulvovaginal atrophy. The primary hypothesis of this study was that neural stimulation may induce healthy changes in the vaginal microbiome, thereby improving genital arousal FSD symptoms. In this study we used healthy rats, which are a common animal model for sexual function, however the rat vaginal microbiome is understudied. Thus this study also sought to examine the composition of the rat vaginal microbiota. Treatment rats (n = 5) received 30 minutes of cutaneous electrical stimulation targeting the genital branch of the pudendal nerve, and Control animals (n = 4) had 30-minute sessions without stimulation. Vaginal lavage samples were taken during a 14-day baseline period including multiple estrous periods and after twice-weekly 30-minute sessions across a six-week trial period. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences was used to characterize the rat vaginal microbiota in baseline samples and determine the effect of stimulation. We found that the rat vaginal microbiota is dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, which changed in relative abundance during the estrous cycle and in relationship to each other. While the overall stimulation effects were unclear in these healthy rats, some Treatment animals had less alteration in microbiota composition between sequential samples than Control animals, suggesting that stimulation may help stabilize the vaginal microbiome. Future studies may consider additional physiological parameters, in addition to the microbiome composition, to further examine vaginal health and the effects of stimulation.",journal_pone_0230170.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a4cdad8628721d35b728a0088e7d7fff/7d86f892/journal_pone_0230170.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

biology. Specifically, the extent to which more

preferences due to phylogenetic conservation – or if
they are forced apart by competition – is still
debated. Here, we explored the co-occurrence patterns of freshwater cyanobacteria at the sub-genus
level to investigate whether more closely related taxa
share more similar niches and to what extent these
niches were defined by abiotic or biotic variables. We
used deep 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and
measured several abiotic environmental parameters

Synechococcus (in the continuous range of 93%–
100% nucleotide identity in 16S) had an increased
tendency to co-occur with one another (i.e. had similar realized niches). This tendency could not be easily
explained by shared preferences for measured abiotic niche dimensions. Thus, commonly measured
abiotic parameters might not be sufficient to characterize, nor to predict community assembly or dynamics. Rather, co-occurrence between Synechococcus
and the surrounding community (whether or not they
represent true biological interactions) may be a more
sensitive measure of realized niches. Overall, our
results suggest that realized niches are phylogenetically conserved, at least at the sub-genus level and
at the resolution of the 16S marker. Determining how
these results generalize to other genera and at finer

This prevents us from discovering whether life is or ever was present on Mars. DNA is an ideal target biosignature since it is unambiguous, nonspecific, and readily detectable with nanopore sequencing. Here, we present a proof-of-concept utilization of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencer for direct life detection and show how it can complement results from established space mission instruments. We used nanopore sequencing data from the MinION to detect and characterize the microbial life in a set of paleochannels near Hanksville, UT, with supporting data from X-ray diffraction, reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Life Detector Chip (LDChip) microarray immunoassay analyses. These paleochannels are analogs to martian sinuous ridges. The MinION-generated metagenomes reveal a rich microbial community dominated by bacteria and containing radioresistant, psychrophilic, and halophilic taxa. With spectral data and LDChip immunoassays, these metagenomes were linked to the surrounding Mars analog environment and potential metabolisms (e.g., methane production and perchlorate reduction). This shows a high degree of synergy between these techniques for detecting and characterizing biosignatures. We also resolved a prospective lower limit of ∼0.001 ng of DNA required for successful sequencing.

A control group of sixty chickens received water free of HgCl2. Our results suggested that mercury exposure reduced the body weight and changed the cecal morphology of chickens after the 90-day treatment. Furthermore, sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA gene revealed that the diversity and composition of cecal microbiota in chickens differed between the control and exposure group. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria and Tenericutes phyla both significantly increased in mercury exposure groups on day 30 while only Tenericutes phyla significantly increased on day 60. At the genus level, we observed that the change in microbial populations are most dramatic on day 30. Besides, compared with the control group, the genus Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 significantly increased in exposure group on day 30 but showed no significant difference on day 60, whereas there was a significant decrease on day 90. PICRUSt analysis revealed potential metabolic changes, such as Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and Metabolism of xenobiotics, associated with mercury exposure in chickens.

Metagenomic Characterization of Chesapeake Bay Virioplankton,PRJNA16522,5/10/2007,"Shellie R. Bench,K Eric WOmmack","College of Marine and Earth Studies, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware 19711, USA.",American Society for Microbiology,"Virus,Biosphere,Chesapeake bay,Viroplankton,marine",https://aem.asm.org/content/73/23/7629.long,,"Viruses are ubiquitous and abundant throughout the biosphere. In marine systems, virus-mediated processes can have significant impacts on microbial diversity and on global biogeocehmical cycling. However, viral genetic diversity remains poorly characterized. To address this shortcoming, a metagenomic library was constructed from Chesapeake Bay virioplankton. The resulting sequences constitute the largest collection of long-read double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral metagenome data reported to date. BLAST homology comparisons showed that Chesapeake Bay virioplankton contained a high proportion of unknown (homologous only to environmental sequences) and novel (no significant homolog) sequences. This analysis suggests that dsDNA viruses are likely one of the largest reservoirs of unknown genetic diversity in the biosphere. The taxonomic origin of BLAST homologs to viral library sequences agreed well with reported abundances of cooccurring bacterial subphyla within the estuary and indicated that cyanophages were abundant. However, the low proportion of Siphophage homologs contradicts a previous assertion that this family comprises most bacteriophage diversity. Identification and analyses of cyanobacterial homologs of the psbA gene illustrated the value of metagenomic studies of virioplankton. The phylogeny of inferred PsbA protein sequences suggested that Chesapeake Bay cyanophage strains are endemic in that environment. The ratio of psbA homologous sequences to total cyanophage sequences in the metagenome indicated that the psbA gene may be nearly universal in Chesapeake Bay cyanophage genomes. Furthermore, the low frequency of psbD homologs in the library supports the prediction that Chesapeake Bay cyanophage populations are dominated by Podoviridae.

Viruses are the most numerically abundant biological entities in marine ecosystems (9, 49, 62), and the ecological importance of marine viruses is supported by a growing body of research (for reviews, see references 61, 67, and 73). Viruses are an important component of the marine microbial loop (7, 12, 30, 62, 69), and it is likely that all members of marine microbial communities (protists, microalgae, and prokaryotes) are prone to viral infection (17). Marine viral lysis impacts global carbon cycles by enhancing dissolved organic matter recycling, decreasing transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels, and exporting particulate organic carbon from the photic zone (30, 41, 42, 61). For example, viruses can significantly influence concentrations of micronutrients, such as iron, by cell lysis (47) or by acting as nucleation centers for iron adsorption and precipitation (26).

In addition to direct impacts on ocean biogeochemistry, the viral infection process may significantly alter the structure of microbial host communities. Virus-mediated changes in community genetic diversity are induced by selective infection and lysis of abundant community members (45, 63). Thus, host-selective viral infection may increase the overall clonal diversity of microbial host populations by removing numerically dominant community members from particular niches. Viruses, particularly bacteriophages, can also directly alter the phenotypes of host cells through genetic exchange (specific and generalized transduction) (44) or through the cryptic infectious state known as lysogeny (50), which has been observed in many marine ecosystems, especially under conditions which are unfavorable for host growth (40, 70). Because viral nucleic acids are incorporated into the host genome, lysogeny can lead to phage-mediated phenotypic conversion of prokaryotic hosts (44, 50).

The effects of viral infection in marine ecosystems emerge from the collective phage-host interactions in marine microbial communities. However, with the exception of a few well-known bacteriophages (e.g., T4, T7, λ, and P20), relatively little is known about the genetic capabilities and phenotypic characteristics of the vast majority of viruses. Whole-genome sequence data for a small collection of marine bacteriophage-host systems have revealed that the phages carry an unusually high proportion of unknown genes and have previously unexpected gene functions, such as involvement in phosphate uptake (e.g., phoH in Roseophage SIO1) (53) and photosynthesis (e.g., psbA in marine cyanophage) (38, 58, 59). Genomic investigations of phycoviruses have also revealed a high proportion of unknown genes and unusual functional genes, such as genes involved in the induction of apoptosis (71). Although investigations of single phage-host systems have provided unparalleled insights into these interactions, a broader understanding of virioplankton composition and diversity can come only from cultivation-independent approaches.

Characterization of whole viral assemblages based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has indicated that marine virioplankton community diversity varies dynamically in response to both seasonal and spatial gradients in ecosystem properties (74, 75) and that these changes mirror those in host bacterial communities (33). Higher-resolution surveys using marker genes (e.g., g20 and DNA polymerase genes) within specific lineages of virioplankton have uncovered extraordinary diversity (23, 77), yet some viral strains have been found in nearly all marine environments (15, 56, 57). While PFGE and marker genotyping approaches have been critical in the development of a foundation for synecological studies of virioplankton, they are limited either in resolution (PFGE) or breadth (marker genotyping).

Characterization of microbial communities using high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatic approaches (i.e., metagenomics) addresses some of the limitations of these approaches and provides a high-resolution view of microbial diversity, as well as the potential functional capabilities within these assemblages. Based on the few metagenome surveys of marine viral communities completed to date, a consensus is emerging that virioplankton communities are extraordinarily diverse and contain a high proportion of unknown sequences (27). Against the typical backdrop of over 60% unknown sequences, viral metagenome libraries tend to contain a collection of gene homologs that are relatively distant from better-known representatives in bacterial genomes (13, 16). Despite the predisposition for horizontal gene transfer between bacteriophage genomes (32), there appears to be a specific “marine” aspect to virioplankton assemblages, which are dominated by genes from marine phages and cyanophages in particular (6). Analyses of a large database of short-read (∼100-base) sequences from four oceanic regions estimated that the compositions of virioplankton assemblages were extraordinarily even, that the assemblages contained between 500 and 130,000 genotypes, and that there were significant overlaps in genotype composition between disparate geographic regions (6).

While viral communities in near-shore waters, sediments, and open oceans have been examined (6, 13, 16), the genomes of virioplankton in a highly productive estuarine ecosystem have not been described in detail. Previous investigations characterizing bacterioplankton diversity demonstrated that the variable estuarine environment selects for a unique bacterioplankton assemblage whose composition is temporally and spatially dynamic (25, 34). The earliest demonstrations that virioplankton exhibit seasonally dynamic patterns of abundance (72), diversity, and composition (74, 75) were obtained from studies of the Chesapeake Bay. This report describes an analysis of the first estuarine viral community metagenome from the Chesapeake Bay in terms of the viral community's taxonomic, functional, and genotypic diversity.",,Metagenomic,Aqib Rahim,

Here, we performed a time series sampling at a small pond in Japan during a Microcystis bloom and then investigated the genomic information and transcriptional dynamics of Microcystis-interacting viruses using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. We identified 15 viral genomic fragments classified into three groups, groups I (including Ma-LMM01), II (high abundance and transcriptional activity), and III (new lineages). According to the phylogenetic distribution of Microcystis strains possessing spacers against each viral group, the group II-original viruses interacted with all three phylogenetically distinct Microcystis population types (phylotypes), whereas the groups I and III-original viruses interacted with only one or two phylotypes, indicating the cooccurrence of broad- (group II) and narrow (groups I and III)-host-range viruses in the bloom. These viral fragments showed the highest transcriptional levels during daytime regardless of their genomic differences. Interestingly, M. aeruginosa expressed antiviral defense genes in the environment, unlike what was seen with an Ma-LMM01 infection in a previous culture experiment. Given that broad-host-range viruses often induce antiviral responses within alternative hosts, our findings suggest that such antiviral responses might inhibit viral multiplication, mainly that of broad-host-range viruses like those in group II.",PRJDB7435.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b3848b43f0173ad1cb3ff236e6e85493/b213e82a/PRJDB7435.pdf),"Metagenomic,Metatranscriptomic",Maria Meza,

We investigated whether these represented known or novel lineages in the Fusobacterium genus, and assessed their genomes for features implicated in development of cancer.

Methods: Prevalence and relative abundances of fusobacterial species were calculated from 3157 CRC and non-CRC gut metagenomes representing 16 populations from various biogeographies. Microbial genomes were assembled and compared with existing reference genomes to assess novel fusobacterial diversity. Phylogenetic distribution of virulence genes implicated in CRC was investigated.

Results: Irrespective of CRC disease status, southern Chinese populations harboured increased prevalence (maximum 39% vs 7%) and relative abundances (average 0.4% vs 0.04% of gut community) of multiple recognised and novel fusobacterial taxa phylogenetically distinct from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Genomes assembled from southern Chinese gut metagenomes increased existing fusobacterial diversity by 14.3%. Homologues of the FadA adhesin linked to CRC were consistently detected in several monophyletic lineages sister to and inclusive of F. varium and F. ulcerans, but not F. mortiferum. We also detected increased prevalence and relative abundances of F. varium in CRC compared with non-CRC cohorts, which together with distribution of FadA homologues supports a possible association with gut disease.

Conclusion: The proportion of fusobacteria in guts of southern Chinese populations are higher compared with several western and rural populations in line with the notion of environment/biogeography driving human gut microbiome composition. Several non-nucleatum taxa possess FadA homologues and were enriched in CRC cohorts; whether this imposes a risk in developing CRC and other gut diseases deserves further investigation.",PRJNA557323.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/28f267b8a64bb36b08f5f8df32ceb50b/f925feb8/PRJNA557323.pdf),Metagenomic,Maria Meza,

The results from conventional pour plating techniques and amplicon-based sequencing were combined. The kefir drinks have also been characterized in terms of their physico-chemical and colorimetric parameters. A bacterial shift from Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens to Acetobacter syzygii, Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides from kefir grains in traditional kefir to backslopped kefir was generally observed. Despite some differences within samples, the dominant mycobiota of backslopped kefir samples remained quite similar to that of the kefir grain samples. However, unlike the lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria, the yeast counts decreased progressively from the grains to the backslopped kefir. The backslopped kefir samples showed higher protein, lactose and ash content and lower ethanol content compared to traditional kefir samples, coupled with optimal pH values that contribute to a pleasant sensory profile. Concerning the volatilome, backslopped kefir samples were correlated with cheesy, buttery, floral and fermented odors, whereas the traditional kefir samples were correlated with alcoholic, fruity, fatty and acid odors. Overall, the data obtained in the present study provided evidence that different kefir production methods (traditional vs backslopping) affect the quality characteristics of the final product.

Deception Island (active volcano in the South Shetland Islands) is affected by ascending hydrothermal fluids

temperature on the community structure and metabolism of three microbial mats collected along the geothermal
band of Cerro Caliente registering 88C, 8C, and 2C at the time of collection. High-throughput sequencing
of small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA) genes and Life Detector Chip (LDChip) microarray
immunoassays revealed different bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic composition in the three mats. The mat at
88C showed the less diverse microbial community and a higher proportion of thermophiles (e.g., Thermales).
In contrast, microbial communities in the mats at 2C and 8C showed relatively higher diversity and higher
proportion of psychrophiles (e.g., Flavobacteriales). Despite this overall association, similar microbial structures at the phylum level (particularly the presence of Cyanobacteria) and certain hot- and cold-tolerant
microorganisms were identified in the three mats. Daily thermal oscillations recorded in the substrate over the
year (4.5–76C) may explain the coexistence of microbial fingerprints with different thermal tolerances. Stable
isotope composition also revealed metabolic differences among the microbial mats. Carbon isotopic ratios suggested the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle as the major pathway for carbon dioxide fixation in the mats at 2C and
8C, and the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle and/or the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle for the mat at 88C,
indicating different metabolisms as a function of the prevailing temperature of each mat. The comprehensive

These alterations are now generally viewed as transformational shifts of the microbial populations associated with health leading to the emergence of bacterial species, which are only present in low abundance in health and a proportionate decrease in the abundance of others. The role of this dysbiosis of the health associated microbiota in the development of disease remains controversial: is this altered microbiology the driving agent of disease or merely a consequence of the altered environmental conditions that invariably accompany destructive disease? In this work, we aimed to address this controversy through controlled transmission experiments in the mouse in which a dysbiotic oral microbiome was transferred either horizontally or vertically into healthy recipient mice. The results of these murine studies demonstrate conclusively that natural transfer of the dysbiotic oral microbiome from a periodontally diseased individual into a healthy individual will lead to establishment of the dysbiotic community in the recipient and concomitant transmission of the disease phenotype. The inherent resilience of the dysbiotic microbial community structure in diseased animals was further demonstrated by analysis of the effects of antibiotic therapy on periodontally diseased mice. Although antibiotic treatment led to a reversal of dysbiosis of the oral microbiome, in terms of both microbial load and community structure, dysbiosis of the microbiome was reestablished following cessation of therapy. Collectively, these data suggest that an oral dysbiotic microbial community structure is stable to transfer and can act in a similar manner to a conventional transmissible infectious disease agent with concomitant effects on pathology.

Implementing practices that maximize water use efficiency in arid zones is important as agriculture relies mostly on irrigation in these agroecosystems. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of combining different sowing irrigation methods (dry and wet) with contrasting tillage practices (conventional practices and conservation agriculture) on bacterial community structure in soils from the Norman E. Borlaug experimental field (CENEB), Yaqui Valley, Sonora.

Materials and methods
Soil samples were collected consecutively four times in the month after sowing from permanent and conventionally tilled beds under wet and dry sowing at CENEB. Soils were characterized and the bacterial communities were identified with Illumina MiSeq sequencing where the 16S rRNA gene was targeted.

Results and discussion
The bacterial community structure was affected by soil water content. Streptomyces and Balneimonas were enriched in dry sowed soil, the first in conventionally tilled beds and the latter in permanent beds, while Acinetobacter was enriched in wet sowed soil under conservation agriculture. Shannon index indicated that there was a high species diversity in both conventional practices and conservation agriculture.

Conclusions
Soil water content was the principal factor shaping the bacterial community structure. While the three most dominant phyla were affected by the difference in water content in the tillage practices under dry and wet sowing, it was at the genera level that these fluctuations were more obvious.",,,Suraj Patel,

High-throughput environmental DNA analysis informs a biological assessment of an urban stream,PRJNA542144,15/5/2019,"Mark Bagley,AabirBanerji","a United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, 26 Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, United States b Midwest Biodiversity Institute, 4673 Northwest Parkway, Hilliard, OH 43026, United States",ScienceDirect,"eDNA,Bioassessment,Taxonomy,Biological impairment,Aquatic life use",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19303346,,"There is growing interest in the use of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding approaches to aid biological assessments and monitoring of waterbodies. While biodiversity measured by morphology and by DNA often has been found correlated, few studies have compared DNA data to established measures of impairment such as multimetric pollution tolerance indices used by many bioassessment programs. We incorporated environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seston into a rigorous watershed-scale biological assessment of an urban stream to examine the extent to which eDNA richness and diversity patterns were correlated with multimetric indices and ecological impairment status designations. We also evaluated different filtering approaches and taxonomic classifications to identify best practices for environmental assessments. Seston eDNA revealed a wide diversity of eukaryotic taxa but was dominated by diatoms (36%). Differentiation among sites in alpha and beta diversity was greater when operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified taxonomically, but coarse resolution taxonomy (kingdom) was more informative than finer resolution taxonomy (family, genus). Correlations of DNA richness and diversity with multimetric indices for fish and macroinvertebrates were generally weak, possibly because Metazoa were not highly represented in our DNA dataset. Nonetheless, sites could be differentiated based on ecological impairment status, with more impaired sites having lower eDNA diversity as measured by the Shannon index, but higher taxonomic richness. Significant environmental drivers of community structure, as inferred from constrained ordination analyses, differed among kingdoms within the eDNA dataset, as well as from fish and macrobenthos, suggesting that eDNA provides novel environmental information. These results suggest that even a simple seston eDNA filtering protocol can provide biodiversity information of value to stream bioassessment programs. The approach bears further investigation as a potentially useful rapid assessment protocol to supplement more intensive field sampling efforts.",,,Suraj Patel,

The objective of this study was to understand the microbial community composition of AOB and NOB enrichments using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The analysis revealed 2948 and 1069 OTUs at 97% similarity index and Shannon alpha diversity index of 7.64 and 4.85 for AOB and NOB enrichments, respectively. Comparative analysis showed that a total of 887 OTUs were common among AOB and NOB enrichments. The AOB and NOB enrichment were dominated by Eubacteria at 96% and 99.7% respectively. Proteobacterial phylum constituted 31.46% (AOB) and 39.75% (NOB) and dominated by α-Proteobacteria (20%) in AOB and γ-Proteobacteria (16%) in NOB. Among the species in AOB enrichment (2,948) two sequences were assigned to ammonia oxidising bacterial group belonging to Nitrosomonas, and Nitrosococcus genera and two belonged to archaeon group comprising Nitrosopumilus and Candidatus Nitrososphaeraea genera. The NOB enrichment was predominated by Nitrospiraceae and Thermodesulfovibrionaceae. Further, the data revealed the presence of heterotrophic bacteria contributing to the process of nitrification and form microcosm with the AOB and NOB. PICRUSt analysis predicted the presence of 24 different nitrogen cycling genes involved in nitrification, denitrification, ammonia and nitrogen transporter family, nitrate reduction and ammonia assimilation.

However, such high dosage inevitably caused serious concerns on operation, potential biological toxicity and excessive sludge production. Thus, this study investigated the effect of micro-dosing of ferrous salt at the level of 0.02 mM on enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) in sequencing batch reactors. Results showed that micro-dosing of ferrous salt enhanced the overall performance, with average COD, TN and TP removal of more than 4.2%, 2.0% and 5.8%, respectively. In addition, the sequencing analysis further revealed that micro-ferrous dosing could significantly improve the diversity and richness of the microbial community (p < 0.05), whereas the regular dosing of ferrous salts (0.25 mM) negatively impacted on the EBPR performance. It was found that the abundances of phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) in R2 (micro-dosing) were nearly 1.5-fold and 2-fold higher than those in R1 (control) and R3 (regular dosing). The contributions of biological and chemical pathways towards the observed phosphorus removal were also determined according to the phosphorus releasing rate. For micro-dosage and regular dosage of ferrous salts, phosphorus removal mainly relied on biological phosphorus removal and chemical phosphorus removal, respectively. It appears from this this study that the micro-ferrous dosing strategy is practically feasible and economically viable for enhanced phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater.",,,Suraj Patel,

Animals were infected with different strains and doses of M. tuberculosis in three independent experiments, resulting in a range of disease severities. The compositions of the microbiotas were then assessed using a combination of 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing in fecal samples collected pre- and postinfection. Clustering analyses of the microbiota compositions revealed that alterations in the microbiome after M. tuberculosis infection were of much lower magnitude than the variability seen between individual monkeys. However, the microbiomes of macaques that developed severe disease were noticeably distinct from those of the animals with less severe disease as well as from each other. In particular, the bacterial families Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae were enriched in monkeys that were more susceptible to infection, while numbers of Streptococcaceae were decreased. These findings in infected nonhuman primates reveal that certain baseline microbiome communities may strongly associate with the development of severe tuberculosis following infection and can be more important disease correlates than alterations to the microbiota following M. tuberculosis infection itself.",mBio-2019-Namasivayam-e01018-19_full.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e389875a882bb71968ae8351e1073ebc/ac383237/mBio-2019-Namasivayam-e01018-19_full.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of cecum microbiota of crossbred Korean native pigs at two different growth stages (stage L = 10 weeks, and stage LD = 26 weeks) using 16S rRNA sequencing technology. Our results revealed remarkable differences in microbial composition, α and β diversity, and differential abundance between the two stages.

Similarly, Bacteroidetes were present at 37.28% and 45.98% in L and LD, respectively. The genera Prevotella, Anaerovibrio, Succinivibrio, Megasphaera were differentially enriched in stage L, whereas Clostridium, Terrisporobacter, Rikenellaceae were enriched in stage LD. Functional annotation of microbiome by level-three KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that glycine, serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine arginine, proline, and tryptophan metabolism were differentially enriched in stage L, whereas alanine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis metabolism were differentially enriched in stage LD. Through machine-learning approaches such as LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size), random forest, and Pearson’s correlation, we found pathways such as amino acid metabolism, transport systems, and genetic regulation of metabolism are commonly enriched in both stages. Our findings suggest that the bacterial compositions in cecum content of pigs are heavily involved in their nutrient digestion process.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the microbiota and the mycobiota occurring in artisan Gioddu sampled from three Sardinian producers by combining the results of viable counting on selective culture media and high-throughput sequencing. Physico-chemical parameters were also measured. The overall low pH values (3.80–4.22) recorded in the analyzed Gioddu samples attested the strong acidifying activity carried out by lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. Viable counts revealed the presence of presumptive lactococci, presumptive lactobacilli and non-Saccharomyces yeasts. A complex (kefirlike) microbiota of bacteria and yeasts was unveiled through sequencing. In more detail, Lactobacillus delbrueckii was found to dominate in Gioddu together with Streptococcus thermophilus, thus suggesting the establishment of a yogurt-like protocooperation. Unexpectedly, in all the three analyzed batches from two out of the three producers Lactobacillus kefiri was also detected, thus representing an absolute novelty, which suggests the presence
of bioactive compounds (e.g. exopolysaccharides) similar to those characterizing milk kefir beverage. Mycobiota population, studied for the very first time in Gioddu, revealed a more complex composition, with Kluyveromyces marxianus, Galactomyces candidum and Geotrichum galactomyces constituting the core species.

Lake Lucero is a highly dynamic environment, strongly characterized by the capillary action of the groundwater, the extreme seasonality of the climate, and the hypersalinity. Sediments are predominantly composed of gypsum with minor quartz, thenardite, halite, quartz, epsomite, celestine, and clays. Geochemical analysis has revealed the predominance of nitrates over ammonium in all of the analyzed samples, indicating oxygenated conditions throughout the sediment column and in groundwater.
Conversely, the microbial communities are primarily aerobic, gram-negative, and are largely characterized by their survival adaptations. Halophiles and oligotrophs are ubiquitous for all the samples. The very diverse communities contain methanogens, phototrophs, heterotrophs, saprophytes, ammonia-oxidizers, sulfur-oxidizers, sulfatereducers,
iron-reducers, and nitrifiers. The microbial diversity varied significantly between groundwater and sediment samples as their temperature adaptation inferences that revealed potential psychrophiles inhabiting the groundwater and thermophiles and mesophiles being present in the sediment. The dynamism of this environment manifests
in the relatively even character of the sediment hosted microbial communities, where significant taxonomic distinctions were observed. Therefore, sediment and groundwater substrates are considered as separate ecological entities. We hope that the variety of

B. velezensis FKM10 was previously isolated from rhizosphere soil of apple trees and shows potential as a plant growth-promoting and biocontrol bacterium. In this study, strain FKM10 was verified to inhibit some fungal pathogens of soil-borne plant diseases, produce siderophores to absorb ferric iron for plants, and degrade proteins. Pot experiments showed that the application of strain FKM10 could directly promote the growth of Malus hupehensis Rehd. by increasing biomass, promoting the absorption of nutrients, improving soil fertility, changing the soil microbial community structure, and reducing fungal diversity. The results of this study provided a basis for using strain FKM10 to improve crop yield and overcome diseases of plants. The mechanism of strain FKM10 to control the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides was studied by interoperation with RNA sequencing. Strain FKM10 can destroy the cell wall and cell membrane of F. verticillioides. The secretion of glucosidases, such as b-glucanase, might be one of the causes of the destruction of the fungal cell wall. The regulation of
amino acid metabolism might also play an important role in the antibacterial process of strain FKM10. During the antibacterial process, strain FKM10 attacks F. verticillioides and strain FKM10 itself is also affected: the expression of spores is increased, the number of viable cells is decreased, and the ribonucleoprotein complex and flagellar
assembly-related genes are downregulated. The results of this study indicate that both strain FKM10 and F. verticillioides have mutually inhibitory activities in a liquid environment. Comparative genome analysis of B. velezensis FKM10 reveals that the general features of their genomes are similar overall and contain the core genome for this species.

Here, we present the first pan-European study on this topic, comprising 255 freshwater lakes. We investigated Limnohabitans and Polynucleobacter using an amplicon sequencing approach of partial 16S rRNA genes along environmental gradients. We show that physico-chemical factors had the greatest impact on both genera. Analyses on environmental gradients revealed an exceptionally broad ecological spectrum of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Despite the coarse resolution of the genetic marker, we found OTUs with contrasting environmental preferences within Polynucleobacter and Limnohabitans subclusters. Such an ecological differentiation has been characterized for PnecC and LimC before but was so far unknown for less well studied subclusters such as PnecA and PnecB.

In many cases, these symptoms are observed years before motor impairments become apparent. Hence, the molecular and cellular underpinnings that contribute to this early GI dysfunction in PD have actively been explored using a relevant animal model. The MitoPark model is a chronic, progressive mouse model recapitulating several key pathophysiological aspects of PD. However, GI dysfunction and gut microbiome changes have not been categorized in this model. Herein, we show that decreased GI motility was one of the first non-motor symptoms to develop, evident as early as 8 weeks with significantly different transit times from 12 weeks onwards. These symptoms were observed well before motor symptoms developed, thereby paralleling PD progression in humans. At age 24 weeks, we observed increased colon transit time and reduced fecal water content, indicative of constipation. Intestinal inflammation was evidenced with increased expression of iNOS and TNFα in the small and large intestine. Specifically, iNOS was observed mainly in the enteric plexi, indicating enteric glial cell activation. A pronounced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons occurred at 24 weeks both in the mid-brain region as well as the gut, leading to a corresponding decrease in dopamine (DA) production. We also observed decreased DARPP-32 expression in the colon, validating the loss of DAergic neurons in the gut. However, the total number of enteric neurons did not significantly differ between the two groups. Metabolomic gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of fecal samples showed increased sterol, glycerol, and tocopherol production in MitoPark mice compared to age-matched littermate controls at 20 weeks of age while 16 s microbiome sequencing showed a transient temporal increase in the genus Prevotella. Altogether, the data shed more light on the role of the gut dopaminergic system in maintaining intestinal health. Importantly, this model recapitulates the chronology and development of GI dysfunction along with other non-motor symptoms and can become an attractive translational animal model for pre-clinical assessment of the efficacy of new anti-Parkinsonian drugs that can alleviate GI dysfunction in PD.",PRJNA559904.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/809b3dae15e46fe4a6d6d1969c1264e0/08fc7edb/PRJNA559904.pdf),"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon,illumina",Maria Meza,

Methods: Healthy maternal and neonatal pairs that underwent vaginal birth and caesarean section were enrolled in this study. Meconium, placenta, membrane and amniotic fluid samples for newborns and vaginal, rectal and oral samples for mothers were collected. All samples were amplified and sequenced by a 16S rRNA gene primer set targeting bacteria and archaea. 
Findings: A total of 550 samples from 36 mother-neonate pairs with vaginal births and 42 mother- neonate pairs with caesarean sections were included in this study. The negative controls showed that the data analysis in this study was not affected by contamination. There was a high diversity of microbial communities in the pregnancy environment of the foetus. Meconium samples could be divided into three distinct types that were not influenced by the delivery method. 
Interpretation: The distribution patterns of bacterial communities in the meconium, placenta, and foetal membranes were highly similar and had nothing to do with the mode of delivery.

A total of 85 mice were inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 strain Ec231 [nalidixic acid resistant (NalAcR)] via oral gavage, and were randomized into six groups separated into three categories: 1st category received PBS or No phage/No PBS (control), 2nd category received either F.O.P., F.O.P. at 1:10 dilution, or only the E. coli phage component of F.O.P. (EcoShield PXTM), and 3rd category received the antibiotic ampicillin. All therapies were administered twice daily for
four consecutive days including before and after bacterial challenge; except ampicillin which was administered only before and after bacterial challenge on day 0. Fecal samples were collected at Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. Samples were homogenized and plated on LB plates supplemented with NalAc to determine viable Ec231 counts. Body
weights were measured at every fecal sample collection point. qPCR was performed using specific E. coli O157:H7 primers to quantify the number of E. coli O157:H7 genome copies.

However, there were significant differences between mixed group and camels at α- and β-diversities. We speculate that grazing management can shape gut microbialdiversity indirectly. Mixed grazing under the control of herdsman lead to similarities in the diversityof gut microbiota among different species and limit their diversities of gut microbiota, which is not conducive to healthy growth of the host. On the contrary, free-range grazing is better for the diversity of gut microbiota. In order to sustainably manage populations of livestock, gut microbiota analysis
may prove to be an important indicator for evaluating the merits of different grazing management strategies. Our results lay a foundation to improve the health of livestock and grazing management.

The hindgut microbial composition of postweaning heifers differed among breed groups. The mucin-degrading bacterium Akkermansia known for promoting energy expenditure was enriched in Brahman calves that contained less intramuscular fat content, while butyrate-producing bacterium Faecalibacterium was linearly positively correlated with Angus proportion. Moreover, the higher relative abundance of beta-lactam resistant genes including ampC gene and arcA gene was associated with the greater Brahman proportion. As the first study aimed at understanding changes in hindgut microbiota among beef cattle with linear gradient of breed composition and its association with marbling in meat, our results suggest that the effects of animal genetics on the gut microbiota structure is associated with fat deposition and potentially a factor affecting the gut antimicrobial resistance.",fmicb-10-01846.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/562bfdf21ee4d490b336bd62c15b543b/f6def5eb/fmicb-10-01846.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

After the samples were filtered and total DNA was extracted, Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to profile the spatiotemporal distributions in bacterioplankton communities, the belt diversity, and the influencing factors during this period of time. The results showed that Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla. Biological differences in cultivated species were the main influencing factors that shaped bacterioplankton communities. Monthly variations and thermal stratification provided little and no contribution to bacterioplankton communities, respectively. CODmn, Chla, and TN were the most appropriate parameters to describe the environmental interpretation of bacterial ordinations, and CODmn was the predominant factor. In addition, the higher similarity between CODmn and Chla, shown by clustering analysis, indicated that the algae-bacteria symbiotic system may have an important role in material circulation in freshwater aquaculture pond water during the peak period of culture.

High rainfall (1200–8000 mm annually) and linked runoff from native forested catchments results in surface LSLs with high tannin concentrations within each fjord. These gradients are expected to drive changes in microbial communities. We used amplicon sequencing (16S and 18S) to assess the impact of these gradients on microbial communities and identified depth linked changes in diversity and community structure. With increasing depth, we observed significant increases in Proteobacteria (15%) and SAR (37%), decreases in Opisthokonta (35%), and transiently increased Bacteroidetes (3% increase from 0 to 40 m, decreasing by 8% at 200 m). Community structure differences were observed along a transect from the head to the mouth, specifically 25% mean relative abundance decreases in Opisthokonta and Bacteroidetes, and increases in SAR (25%) and Proteobacteria (>5%) at the surface, indicating changes based on distance from the ocean.

We measured the metabolic diversity and activity of microbial communities in fjords to determine patterns in metabolic potential across and within fjords, and whether these patterns could be explained by community composition modifications. We demonstrated that metabolic potential and activity are shaped by similar parameters as total (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) microbial communities. However, we identified increases in metabolic diversity and potential (but not in community composition) at near bottom (aphotic) sites consistent with the influence of sediments in deeper waters. Thus, while composition and function of the microbial community in the upper water column was likely shaped by marine snow and sinking POM generated by new production, deeper sites were strongly influenced by sediment resuspension of benthic organic matter generated from this or other sources (terrestrial, chemoautotrophic, microbial carbon loop), uncoupling the community composition and function dynamics.",745273v1_full.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e425b39c13be820600363743a8525e67/d97b8f53/745273v1_full.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

Recent insight has suggested the existence of a crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the epigenome. However, the possible link between alterations in gut microbiome composition and epigenetic marks in obesity has been not explored yet. The aim of this work is to establish a link between the gut microbiota and the global DNA methylation profile in a group of obese subjects and to report potential candidate genes that could be epigenetically regulated by gut microbiota in adipose tissue.

Methods: Gut microbiota composition was analyzed in DNA stool samples from 45 obese subjects by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Twenty patients were selected based on their Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratio (BFR): HighBFR group (BFR > 2.5, n = 10) and LowBFR group (BFR < 1.2, n = 10). Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation pattern in both whole blood and visceral adipose tissue of these selected patients was performed with an Infinium EPIC BeadChip array-based platform. Gene expression analysis of candidate genes was done in adipose tissue by real-time quantitative PCR.

Results: Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation revealed a completely different DNA methylome pattern in both blood and adipose tissue in the low BFR group vs. the high BFR group. Two hundred fifty-eight genes were differentially methylated in both blood and adipose tissue, of which several potential candidates were selected for gene expression analysis. We found that in adipose tissue, both HDAC7 and IGF2BP2 were hypomethylated and overexpressed in the low BFR group compared with the high BFR group. β values of both genes significantly correlated with the BFR ratio and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and/or Firmicutes.

Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate that the DNA methylation status is associated with gut microbiota composition in obese subjects and that the expression levels of candidate genes implicated in glucose and energy homeostasis (e.g., HDAC7 and IGF2BP2) could be epigenetically regulated by gut bacterial populations in adipose tissue.",,,Suraj Patel,

Gut microbiota has been linked to obesity and glucose metabolism. Insufficient sleep is also known to be associated with insulin resistance, and sleep extension was reported to improve glucose metabolism in short sleepers. This study aimed to explore whether sleep extension was associated with changes in gut microbiota and whether there was a relationship with glucose parameters.

Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of eight short-seeping but otherwise healthy subjects who participated in a cross over study of two-week home sleep extension and two weeks of habitual sleep. After each sleep condition, stool samples were collected and glucose parameters were obtained. Stool DNA extraction was performed and 16S rRNA was sequenced by MiSeq™. The resulting sequence data were processed to infer relative abundances of taxa present and then analyzed to detect any differences in the abundances of the taxa or overall diversity of the microbiome.

Results
Mean (SD) sleep duration during habitual sleep and sleep extension was 5.58 (0.53) and 6.60 (0.43) hours/night, respectively. Using the Bray–Curtis index, there was no significant dissimilarity of the genus-level microbial community between the two sleeping conditions (ADONIS, R2 = 0.017, p = 0.988 and ANOSIM, R = −0.131, p = 0.991). Within-sample microbial diversity (ie, the Shannon index) also did not find significant differences (p = 0.861). There was no significant relationship between per-individual dissimilarity and objective and subjective sleep variables, or glycemic parameters. Only higher sleep efficiency was related to higher abundance of the phyla Tenericutes.

Conclusion
Two-week sleep extension in short sleepers was not associated with changes in gut microbiota.",,,Suraj Patel,

Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes6,7,8, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored3,4,5. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person’s gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable ‘core microbiome’ at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Seasonal Dynamics and Metagenomic Characterization of Estuarine Viriobenthos Assemblages by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA PCR,PRJNA33617,13/2/2009,"Rebekah R. Helton,K. Eric Wommack","Rebekah R Helton 1, K Eric Wommack",American Society for Microbiology,"DNA,Sequence Classification,unclassified sequences",https://aem.asm.org/content/75/8/2259.long,,"Direct enumeration and genetic analyses indicate that aquatic sediments harbor abundant and diverse viral communities. Thus far, synecological analysis of estuarine sediment viral diversity over an annual cycle has not been reported. This oversight is due in large part to a lack of molecular genetic approaches for assessing viral diversity within a large collection of environmental samples. Here, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD-PCR) was used to examine viral genotypic diversity within Chesapeake Bay sediments. Using a single 10-mer oligonucleotide primer for all samples, RAPD-PCR analysis of sediment viral assemblages yielded unique banding patterns across spatial and temporal scales, with the occurrence of specific bands varying among the sample set. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR amplicon banding patterns indicated that sediment viral assemblages changed with season and to a lesser extent with geographic location. Sequence analysis of RAPD-PCR amplicons revealed that 76% of sediment viral sequences were not homologous to any sequence in the GenBank nonredundant protein database. Of the GenBank sequence homologs, the majority belonged to viruses within the Podoviridae (24%) and Myoviridae (22%) viral families, which agrees with the previously observed frequencies of these morphological families in Chesapeake Bay sediments. Furthermore, the majority of the sediment viral sequences homologous to GenBank nonredundant protein sequences were phages or prophages (57%). Hence, RAPD-PCR proved to be a reliable and useful approach for characterization of viral assemblages and the genetic diversity of viruses within aquatic sediments.

Large numbers of viruses, an estimated abundance greater than 1031 viruses worldwide (11, 26), have been found in a variety of environments, including seawater (38), freshwater (19), sediments (25, 28), and soils (34). Viruses are not only abundant but also likely to significantly influence the population dynamics and genotypic composition of their bacterial host populations (29, 33). Process-level investigations of viral activity in sediments have shown that viruses are an active component of sediment microbial communities (23). Glud and Middelboe (23) found that bacterial growth rates and viral production increased in parallel with respiration, suggesting that viruses are active members of benthic microbial communities. Previous studies have shown that sediment viral abundance exceeds coexisting bacterial abundance by 10- to 1,000-fold (15, 17, 25), creating the potential for viral processes to influence the microbial ecology of aquatic sediments. However, with the exception of small-scale metagenomic investigations (4, 8), there exists little information on the genetic content of viriobenthos assemblages or how the composition of these assemblages changes over ecological gradients.

Despite the high abundances of viruses in nature, the lack of a shared genetic marker creates a difficult problem when attempting to examine viral genetic diversity in environmental samples (31). Gene g20 encodes a multifunctional protein within the collar between the capsid and tail in T4-like bacteriophages and has been of significant importance in examining the genetic diversity of cyanomyoviruses (22, 24, 32). As well, others have been able to evaluate the diversity of unidentified aquatic picornavirus-like viruses using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (13). Other studies have attempted to examine phage genetic diversity based on the DNA polymerase gene (6, 21). Unfortunately, not all known phages contain these specific genes; hence, their use as universal markers is markedly inadequate. Thus, molecular methods that do not rely on polymorphism analysis of a single gene product must be used to circumvent these limitations.

Recently, metagenomic approaches (i.e., sequencing of random genomic DNA fragments from whole microbial assemblages) have been used to examine genetic diversity within viral (18) and prokaryotic (10) assemblages. For sediment environments, metagenomic analysis has revealed that the viriobenthos is perhaps the most diverse of all viral assemblages, having been estimated to contain more than 10,000 genotypes per kg of sediment (4). Viral assemblages within a wide range of environments including marine (2, 8) and estuarine (3) waters, soils (20), stromatolites (16), and equine (9) and human feces (5, 40) have been examined. Overall, these studies have shown that a relatively low proportion (∼30%) of viral metagenome sequences are similar to sequences found in the nonredundant GenBank database (nr database), but the probability of detecting significant BLAST homologs increases twofold when queries against other viral metagenome sequence libraries are included (3). Thus, the function of most viral genes is currently unknown; however, these genes are broadly distributed among viruses.

While large-scale metagenomics offers unprecedented resolution of the diversity and composition of a viral assemblage, the significant costs and computational requirements preclude routine application in a large collection of environmental samples. Recently, Winget and Wommack (36) introduced a new, low-cost, high-throughput means for genetic analysis of viral diversity utilizing random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD-PCR). In this approach, a single 10-bp oligonucleotide serves as both the forward and reverse primers in a single thermocycler reaction. Target sequences in the template DNA are randomly selected; thus, development of a RAPD-PCR assay requires no prior information on the DNA coding content within the sample or organism—a significant advantage considering the largely unknown nature of most viral genes.

In this study, we assess the potential of RAPD-PCR as a tool to examine genotype-scale compositional changes in the Chesapeake Bay viriobenthos and to explore the genetic diversity of viruses within Chesapeake Bay sediments. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use RAPD-PCR for evaluating sediment viral diversity and documenting compositional changes in viriobenthos assemblages over time and geographic location.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,
Metagenomic Analysis of Apple Orchard Soil Reveals Antibiotic Resistance Genes Encoding Predicted Bifunctional Proteins▿,PRJNA36531,7/5/2010,"Justin J. Donato,Jo Handelsman","Justin J. Donato, Luke A. Moe,† Brandon J. Converse, Keith D. Smart, Flora C. Berklein, Patricia S. McManus, and Jo Handelsman*",Applied and Environmental Microbiology,"Graph Analysis,Antibiotic,Antibiotic resistance,antimicrobial resistance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897439/,,"To gain insight into the diversity and origins of antibiotic resistance genes, we identified resistance genes in the soil in an apple orchard using functional metagenomics, which involves inserting large fragments of foreign DNA into Escherichia coli and assaying the resulting clones for expressed functions. Among 13 antibiotic-resistant clones, we found two genes that encode bifunctional proteins. One predicted bifunctional protein confers resistance to ceftazidime and contains a natural fusion between a predicted transcriptional regulator and a β-lactamase. Sequence analysis of the entire metagenomic clone encoding the predicted bifunctional β-lactamase revealed a gene potentially involved in chloramphenicol resistance as well as a predicted transposase. A second clone that encodes a predicted bifunctional protein confers resistance to kanamycin and contains an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase domain fused to a second acetyltransferase domain that, based on nucleotide sequence, was predicted not to be involved in antibiotic resistance. This is the first report of a transcriptional regulator fused to a β-lactamase and of an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase fused to an acetyltransferase not involved in antibiotic resistance.

In the middle of the 20th century, the discovery of antibiotics dramatically changed the tools available to cure infectious disease. Today, antibiotics control many diseases, but use, overuse, and misuse have led to an alarming increase in the frequency of human pathogens that do not respond to antibiotic therapy (4, 14, 16, 31), underscoring the need for new antibiotics (reviewed in reference 10) and a better understanding of the origins of antibiotic resistance.

Soil microbial communities are potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, but these reservoirs have rarely been studied. Bacteria living in soil are attractive for this investigation because of their inherent genetic diversity and the abundance of antibiotic-producing soil bacteria, which predicts the presence of resistance genes in producers and susceptible target bacteria (1, 27). A study of Streptomyces isolates from diverse soils found that all of the 480 strains tested were resistant to multiple antibiotics (15).

Analysis of antibiotic-resistant bacteria typically involves culturing bacteria from an environmental sample on a medium that contains the antibiotic of interest. However, fewer than 1% of all microbes are readily culturable; thus, culture-based analysis excludes most of the microbial diversity (7-9, 18, 20, 24). To access a broad suite of resistance genes, we previously used functional metagenomics, a technique that enables discovery of antibiotic resistance genes from organisms that may or may not be readily culturable. Additionally, selections for functional enzymes can interrogate all expressed proteins in the library and not just those with sequences homologous to known proteins. This approach has revealed genes that would have been missed by sequence analysis alone (19). Since the overwhelming majority of known antibiotic resistance genes originated from culturable bacteria, there are likely many more resistance elements yet to be found. In addition, many of the known resistance genes are from clinically important bacteria. Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated that certain resistance genes found in soil bacteria are related only distantly to those found in clinical isolates, indicating that more work needs to be done to understand the relationship between resistance genes present in soil and those in clinical isolates (1, 27).

In the current study, we constructed a metagenomic library from soil bacterial communities and screened the library for clones that confer antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, β-lactams, or aminoglycoside antibiotics. We identified 13 clones that conferred resistance to at least one of the antibiotics tested. Among these clones we found genes encoding two putative novel bifunctional enzymes.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Previous research on thermophilic viruses focused on cultivated strains. This study examined metagenomic profiles of viruses directly isolated from two mildly alkaline hot springs, Bear Paw (74°C) and Octopus (93°C). Using a new method for constructing libraries from picograms of DNA, nearly 30 Mb of viral DNA sequence was determined. In contrast to previous studies, sequences were assembled at 50% and 95% identity, creating composite contigs up to 35 kb and facilitating analysis of the inherent heterogeneity in the populations. Lowering the assembly identity reduced the estimated number of viral types from 1,440 and 1,310 to 548 and 283, respectively. Surprisingly, the diversity of viral species in these springs approaches that in moderate-temperature environments. While most known thermophilic viruses have a chronic, nonlytic infection lifestyle, analysis of coding sequences suggests lytic viruses are more common in geothermal environments than previously thought. The 50% assembly included one contig with high similarity and perfect synteny to nine genes from Pyrobaculum spherical virus (PSV). In fact, nearly all the genes of the 28-kb genome of PSV have apparent homologs in the metagenomes. Similarities to thermoacidophilic viruses isolated on other continents were limited to specific open reading frames but were equally strong. Nearly 25% of the reads showed significant similarity between the hot springs, suggesting a common subterranean source. To our knowledge, this is the first application of metagenomics to viruses of geothermal origin.

Subterranean aquifers are vast ecosystems characterized by the absence of solar radiation, the presence of chemical reducing potential, and, under certain conditions, elevated temperatures (31). Estimates of the volume of the global thermal aquifer range as high as 1019 liters (34), with microbial and viral abundances approaching those of the oceans (16). This study examined planktonic viruses directly isolated from two mildly alkaline siliceous hot springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). With temperatures of 74 and 93°C, life in these springs is comprised exclusively of Bacteria, Archaea, and their respective viruses, all uniquely adapted to the temperature and chemistry extremes of the environment (53, 65). These springs are direct outflows of the thermal aquifer and not secondarily heated surface water (31). In this respect, they are distinct from the acidic springs, mudpots, and other thermal features that have provided many of the published thermophilic-virus samples. Conceivably, viruses may proliferate not only at the surface, but deeper in the vent as well, where increased pressures and dramatically elevated temperatures have been measured. Water temperatures of 180 to 270°C are found at depths of 100 to 550 m throughout the caldera of YNP (31). If viruses proliferate in the subsurface aquifer, hot springs separated by kilometer distances that share common water sources may also share viral populations.

Little is known about the roles of viruses in the ecology of hydrothermal environments, although they appear to play a role in host mortality and carbon cycling (16) and are probably the only predators. In better-studied marine environments, an estimated 1030 viruses in the world's oceans (77) may comprise several hundred thousand different species (5). These viruses are responsible for a significant proportion of microbial mortality and thus have a profound influence on carbon and other nutrient cycles (77). Marine viruses are also thought to be important vehicles for lateral gene transfer via lysogeny and transduction and probably promote diversity by preferentially lysing the most abundant species (83). Analysis of viral metagenomes (5, 9, 21) and cultured viral genomes (43, 54) has consistently shown that about 30% of these sequences have detectable similarity to sequences in GenBank, and about half of those are most similar to other known viruses. In spite of extensive sequencing from oceanic phage and viral metagenomic samples, only small RNA genomes of 5 to 10 kb have been assembled (23) from virioplankton metagenomic sequence data.

Enrichment cultivation has been the primary tool for investigations of thermophilic viruses (those growing at >70°C). Since the first reports of thermophilic viruses (47, 69), hundreds of bacteriophages (88), dozens of crenarchaeal viruses (reviewed in references 59, 61, and 74), and one euryarchaeal virus (32) have been isolated from thermal springs and vents around the world. Cultivated Thermus bacteriophages belong to four morphological families: Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Tectiviridae, and Inoviridae (88). Their morphologies and the available genomic sequences (38, 50) suggest similarity to mesophilic bacteriophages. Most known thermophilic bacteriophages appear to be lytic, although this could be biased by the method of their discovery (88). Cultivated thermophilic crenarchaeal viruses infect the genera Sulfolobus, Acidianus, Pyrobaculum, and Thermoproteus. Morphologies and genome contents suggest that crenarchaeal viruses are unrelated to viruses of Euryarchaeota, Bacteria, or Eukarya (57). All of the cultivated crenarchaeal viruses proliferate as chronic, nonlytic infections.

While enrichment cultures have been invaluable in the study of thermophilic viruses, important contextual information, such as relative abundance, diversity, and distribution, is lost (56). Furthermore, these analyses exclude the majority of viruses that are not readily cultivated (73). No viral-cultivation study fully replicates the temperature and pressure extremes and the chemistries that characterize the subsurface vents.

In fact, nearly all the genes of the 28-kb genome of PSV have apparent homologs in the metagenomes. Similarities to thermoacidophilic viruses isolated on other continents were limited to specific open reading frames but were equally strong. Nearly 25% of the reads showed significant similarity between the hot springs, suggesting a common subterranean source. To our knowledge, this is the first application of metagenomics to viruses of geothermal origin.

Subterranean aquifers are vast ecosystems characterized by the absence of solar radiation, the presence of chemical reducing potential, and, under certain conditions, elevated temperatures (31). Estimates of the volume of the global thermal aquifer range as high as 1019 liters (34), with microbial and viral abundances approaching those of the oceans (16). This study examined planktonic viruses directly isolated from two mildly alkaline siliceous hot springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). With temperatures of 74 and 93°C, life in these springs is comprised exclusively of Bacteria, Archaea, and their respective viruses, all uniquely adapted to the temperature and chemistry extremes of the environment (53, 65). These springs are direct outflows of the thermal aquifer and not secondarily heated surface water (31). In this respect, they are distinct from the acidic springs, mudpots, and other thermal features that have provided many of the published thermophilic-virus samples. Conceivably, viruses may proliferate not only at the surface, but deeper in the vent as well, where increased pressures and dramatically elevated temperatures have been measured. Water temperatures of 180 to 270°C are found at depths of 100 to 550 m throughout the caldera of YNP (31). If viruses proliferate in the subsurface aquifer, hot springs separated by kilometer distances that share common water sources may also share viral populations.

Little is known about the roles of viruses in the ecology of hydrothermal environments, although they appear to play a role in host mortality and carbon cycling (16) and are probably the only predators. In better-studied marine environments, an estimated 1030 viruses in the world's oceans (77) may comprise several hundred thousand different species (5). These viruses are responsible for a significant proportion of microbial mortality and thus have a profound influence on carbon and other nutrient cycles (77). Marine viruses are also thought to be important vehicles for lateral gene transfer via lysogeny and transduction and probably promote diversity by preferentially lysing the most abundant species (83). Analysis of viral metagenomes (5, 9, 21) and cultured viral genomes (43, 54) has consistently shown that about 30% of these sequences have detectable similarity to sequences in GenBank, and about half of those are most similar to other known viruses. In spite of extensive sequencing from oceanic phage and viral metagenomic samples, only small RNA genomes of 5 to 10 kb have been assembled (23) from virioplankton metagenomic sequence data.

Enrichment cultivation has been the primary tool for investigations of thermophilic viruses (those growing at >70°C). Since the first reports of thermophilic viruses (47, 69), hundreds of bacteriophages (88), dozens of crenarchaeal viruses (reviewed in references 59, 61, and 74), and one euryarchaeal virus (32) have been isolated from thermal springs and vents around the world. Cultivated Thermus bacteriophages belong to four morphological families: Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Tectiviridae, and Inoviridae (88). Their morphologies and the available genomic sequences (38, 50) suggest similarity to mesophilic bacteriophages. Most known thermophilic bacteriophages appear to be lytic, although this could be biased by the method of their discovery (88). Cultivated thermophilic crenarchaeal viruses infect the genera Sulfolobus, Acidianus, Pyrobaculum, and Thermoproteus. Morphologies and genome contents suggest that crenarchaeal viruses are unrelated to viruses of Euryarchaeota, Bacteria, or Eukarya (57). All of the cultivated crenarchaeal viruses proliferate as chronic, nonlytic infections.

While enrichment cultures have been invaluable in the study of thermophilic viruses, important contextual information, such as relative abundance, diversity, and distribution, is lost (56). Furthermore, these analyses exclude the majority of viruses that are not readily cultivated (73). No viral-cultivation study fully replicates the temperature and pressure extremes and the chemistries that characterize the subsurface vents. Unlike cellular life, no universal genetic marker (e.g., rRNA genes) exists for viruses. Direct metagenomic analysis of viruses from environmental samples circumvents these limitations and provides insight into biology, evolution, and adaptations to the environment and the composition of viral assemblages through studies of gene homology. No metagenomic analysis of waterborne viral populations in geothermal environments has been reported. In fact, planktonic life in thermal environments is underexplored in general, as microbial-diversity studies of hot-spring environments have focused almost exclusively on sediments (7, 10, 39), adherent filaments (64), or mats (82). The goal of this study was to profile the diversity, composition, and adaptations of viral assemblages in two hot springs of YNP based on metagenomic analysis of viruses inhabiting these environments.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Previous research on thermophilic viruses focused on cultivated strains. This study examined metagenomic profiles of viruses directly isolated from two mildly alkaline hot springs, Bear Paw (74°C) and Octopus (93°C). Using a new method for constructing libraries from picograms of DNA, nearly 30 Mb of viral DNA sequence was determined. In contrast to previous studies, sequences were assembled at 50% and 95% identity, creating composite contigs up to 35 kb and facilitating analysis of the inherent heterogeneity in the populations. Lowering the assembly identity reduced the estimated number of viral types from 1,440 and 1,310 to 548 and 283, respectively. Surprisingly, the diversity of viral species in these springs approaches that in moderate-temperature environments. While most known thermophilic viruses have a chronic, nonlytic infection lifestyle, analysis of coding sequences suggests lytic viruses are more common in geothermal environments than previously thought.

Microbiome/host interactions describe characteristics that affect the host's health. Shotgun metagenomics includes sequencing a random subset of the microbiome to analyze its taxonomic and metabolic potential. Reconstruction of DNA fragments into genomes from metagenomes (called metagenome-assembled genomes) assigns unknown fragments to taxa/function and facilitates discovery of novel organisms. Genome reconstruction incorporates sequence assembly and sorting of assembled sequences into bins, characteristic of a genome. However, the microbial community composition, including taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity may influence genome reconstruction. We determine the optimal reconstruction method for four microbiome projects that had variable sequencing platforms (IonTorrent and Illumina), diversity (high or low), and environment (coral reefs and kelp forests), using a set of parameters to select for optimal assembly and binning tools.

Methods
We tested the effects of the assembly and binning processes on population genome reconstruction using 105 marine metagenomes from 4 projects. Reconstructed genomes were obtained from each project using 3 assemblers (IDBA, MetaVelvet, and SPAdes) and 2 binning tools (GroopM and MetaBat). We assessed the efficiency of assemblers using statistics that including contig continuity and contig chimerism and the effectiveness of binning tools using genome completeness and taxonomic identification.

Results
We concluded that SPAdes, assembled more contigs (143,718 ± 124 contigs) of longer length (N50 = 1632 ± 108 bp), and incorporated the most sequences (sequences-assembled = 19.65%). The microbial richness and evenness were maintained across the assembly, suggesting low contig chimeras. SPAdes assembly was responsive to the biological and technological variations within the project, compared with other assemblers. Among binning tools, we conclude that MetaBat produced bins with less variation in GC content (average standard deviation: 1.49), low species richness (4.91 ± 0.66), and higher genome completeness (40.92 ± 1.75) across all projects. MetaBat extracted 115 bins from the 4 projects of which 66 bins were identified as reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes with sequences belonging to a specific genus. We identified 13 novel genomes, some of which were 100% complete, but show low similarity to genomes within databases.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we present a set of biologically relevant parameters for evaluation to select for optimal assembly and binning tools. For the tools we tested, SPAdes assembler and MetaBat binning tools reconstructed quality metagenome-assembled genomes for the four projects.

These cenotes were explored, mapped, and geochemically and microbiologically sampled by the autonomous underwater vehicle deep phreatic thermal explorer (DEPTHX). The community structure of the filterable fraction of the water column and extensive microbial mats that coat the cenote walls was investigated by comparative analysis of small‐subunit (SSU) 16S rRNA gene sequences. Full‐length Sanger gene sequence analysis revealed novel microbial diversity that included three putative bacterial candidate phyla and three additional groups that showed high intra‐clade distance with poorly characterized bacterial candidate phyla. Limited functional gene sequence analysis in these anoxic environments identified genes associated with methanogenesis, sulfate reduction and anaerobic ammonium oxidation.

The community structure of the filterable fraction of the water column and extensive microbial mats that coat the cenote walls was investigated by comparative analysis of small‐subunit (SSU) 16S rRNA gene sequences. Full‐length Sanger gene sequence analysis revealed novel microbial diversity that included three putative bacterial candidate phyla and three additional groups that showed high intra‐clade distance with poorly characterized bacterial candidate phyla.

Studies to date have focused primarily on culturable fungi that represent a fraction of natural fungal populations. The nonculturable fungi, however, can harbor diverse populations of mycoviruses that reduce plant disease or enhance resistance to abiotic stress. Metatranscriptome analysis of field-grown plant samples using high-throughput sequencing offers the possibility of unbiased detection and quantification of mycoviruses regardless of the culturability of their fungal hosts together with the complete associated microbial consortia. In this study, we describe the fungal viromes of the phyllosphere of production soybean fields in Illinois, USA by analyzing the metatranscriptomes of thousands of soybean leaf samples collected during the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. The analyses identified 25 partial genome sequences that represented at least 22 mycovirus genomes, only one of which had been described previously. The novel mycovirus genomes showed similarity to 10 distinct lineages including the genera Alphapartitivirus, Botybirnavirus, Endornavirus, Mitovirus, Mycoflexivirus, Ourmiavirus, Totivirus, Victorivirus, family Tombusviridae, order Mononegavirales, and the recently proposed genus Gemycircularvirus.

The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by a person’s gut microbial community (microbiota) and its component genes (microbiome). Unraveling the interrelations among diet, the structure and operations of the gut microbiota, and nutrient and energy harvest is confounded by variations in human environmental exposures, microbial ecology, and genotype. To help overcome these problems, we created a well-defined, representative animal model of the human gut ecosystem by transplanting fresh or frozen adult human fecal microbial communities into germ-free C57BL/6J mice. Culture-independent metagenomic analysis of the temporal, spatial, and intergenerational patterns of bacterial colonization showed that these humanized mice were stably and heritably colonized and reproduced much of the bacterial diversity of the donor’s microbiota. Switching from a low-fat, plant polysaccharide–rich diet to a high-fat, high-sugar “Western” diet shifted the structure of the microbiota within a single day, changed the representation of metabolic pathways in the microbiome, and altered microbiome gene expression. Reciprocal transplants involving various combinations of donor and recipient diets revealed that colonization history influences the initial structure of the microbial community but that these effects can be rapidly altered by diet. Humanized mice fed the Western diet have increased adiposity; this trait is transmissible via microbiota transplantation. Humanized gnotobiotic mice will be useful for conducting proof-of-principle “clinical trials” that test the effects of environmental and genetic factors on the gut microbiota and host physiology.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,
Specific enrichment of microbes and increased ruminal propionate production: the potential mechanism underlying the high energy efficiency of Holstein heifers fed steam-flaked corn,PRJNA40053,28/12/2019,"Hao Ren,Junhu Yao","Hao Ren, Xiaodong Su, Hanxun Bai, Yuntian Yang, Hongrong Wang, Zeng Dan, Jinbin Lu, Shengru Wu, Chuanjiang Cai, Yangchun Cao, Xinjian Lei & Junhu Yao ",AMB Express,"corn starch,ruminal bacteria,Diet",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13568-019-0937-8,,"Corn grain has a high starch content and is used as main energy source in ruminant diets. Compared with finely ground corn (FGC), steam-flaked corn (SFC) could improve the milk yield of lactating dairy cows and the growth performance of feedlot cattle, but the detailed mechanisms underlying those finding are unknown. The rumen microbiome breaks down feedstuffs into energy substrates for the host animals, and contributes to feed efficiency. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the ruminal bacterial community changes of heifers fed differently processed corn (SFC or FGC) using 16S rRNA sequencing technologies, and to uncover the detailed mechanisms underlying the high performance of ruminants fed the SFC diet. The results revealed that different processing methods changed the rumen characteristics and impacted the composition of the rumen bacteria. The SFC diet resulted in an increased average daily gain in heifers, an increased rumen propionate concentration and a decreased rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration. The relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were tended to increase or significantly increased in the heifers fed SFC diet compared with FGC diet. In addition, the relative abundance of amylolytic bacteria of the genera Succinivibrio, Roseburia and Blautia were elevated, and the cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013) were decreased by the steam flaking method. Spearman correlation analysis between the ruminal bacteria and the microbial metabolites showed that the rumen propionate concentration was positively correlated with genera Succinivibrio and Blautia abundance, but negatively correlated with genera Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 abundance. Evident patterns of efficient improvement in rumen propionate and changes in rumen microbes to further improve feed conversion were identified. This observation uncovers the potential mechanisms underlying the increased efficiency of the SFC processing method for enhancing ruminant performance.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

In this study, the microbial community in the surface peat layer in Pru Toh Daeng, a primary tropical peat swamp forest, was studied for its phylogenetic diversity and metabolic potential using direct shotgun pyrosequencing of environmental DNA, together with analysis of 16S rRNA gene library and key metabolic genes. The community was dominated by aerobic microbes together with a significant number of facultative and anaerobic microbial taxa. Acidobacteria and diverse Proteobacteria (mainly Alphaproteobacteria) constituted the major phylogenetic groups, with minor representation of archaea and eukaryotic microbes. Based on comparative pyrosequencing dataset analysis, the microbial community showed high metabolic versatility of plant polysaccharide decomposition. A variety of glycosyl hydrolases targeting lignocellulosic and starch-based polysaccharides from diverse bacterial phyla were annotated, originating mostly from Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria together with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria, suggesting the key role of these microbes in plant biomass degradation. Pyrosequencing dataset annotation and direct mcrA gene analysis indicated the presence of methanogenic archaea clustering in the order Methanomicrobiales, suggesting the potential on partial carbon flux from biomass degradation through methanogenesis.

Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named ‘Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera’, was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that ‘M. oxyfera’ bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Here, we used a reciprocal transplant experiment to understand the contributions of the environment and the host plant to rhizosphere microbiome composition in locally adapted ecotypes of Mimulus guttatus (syn. Erythranthe guttata). Two genotypes of a coastal ecotype and two genotypes of an inland ecotype were planted at coastal and inland sites. After 3 months, we collected rhizosphere and bulk soil and assessed microbial communities by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that local environment (coastal versus inland site) strongly influenced rhizosphere communities, at least in part due to distinct local microbial species pools. Host identity played a smaller role: at each site, the ecotypes exhibited remarkably similar composition of microbial communities at the class level, indicating that divergent M. guttatus ecotypes recruit phylogenetically similar rhizosphere communities, even in environments to which they are maladapted. Nevertheless, the two ecotypes significantly differed in community composition at both sites due, in part, to an exclusive set of taxa associated with each ecotype. They also differed in alpha diversity at the inland site. Although this indicates that locally adapted M. guttatus ecotypes are genetically diverged in factors shaping rhizosphere communities, our findings highlight the context-specific interactions between host identity and local environment that shape those communities.",,Metagenomic,Alleyah Hanson,

by the smallest soil fraction (~2 nm, e.g., clay) as it provides the largest surface area. To test our hypotheses, culture dependent and independent techniques were used to monitor the presence, abundance and source of FIB and microbial pathogens (bacteria and protists) in water (TWW and potable water) and three irrigated soil types (clay, loam and loamy-sand) in a field study spanning two years. The results showed that FIB and pathogens' abundance were significantly different between water types, yet these differences did
not carry to the irrigated soils.

However, TWW may pose a health risk by introducing pathogens to the irrigated soil and crop, and especially to irrigated vegetables that are eaten raw. To avoid contamination, national and international authorities have mandated the use of physical barriers, such as drip irrigation and plastic mulch, to separate the irrigation water and the crops. Although the barriers are mandated, it is not clear whether they prevent contamination of crops. To evaluate the role of barriers on crop safety, cucumbers and melons were cultivated in a field irrigated with TWW or PW with the application of barriers including surface and subsurface drip irrigation and plastic mulch. Over 500 samples of water, soil and the model crops (surface and tissue) were collected during two growing seasons and used to monitor fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens using culture dependent and independent methods. The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in both the fecal indicator and the pathogen abundance between treatments in either the soil or the crops, regardless of the water quality or barrier applied, even though TWW supported higher diversity and abundance of indicators and pathogens than PW.

Salmonella Typhimurium has the potential to establish a niche by displacing the microbiota in the chicken gut causing continuous faecal shedding that can result in contaminated eggs or egg products. In the current study, we investigated the dynamics of gut microbiota in laying chickens during Salmonella Typhimurium infection. The optimisation of the use of an infeed probiotic supplement for restoration of gut microbial balance and reduction of Salmonella Typhimurium load was also investigated.
Results: Salmonella infection caused dysbiosis by decreasing (FDR < 0.05) the abundance of microbial genera, such as Blautia, Enorma, Faecalibacterium, Shuttleworthia, Sellimonas, Intestinimonas and Subdoligranulum and increasing the abundance of genera such as Butyricicoccus, Erysipelatoclostridium, Oscillibacter and Flavonifractor. The higher Salmonella Typhimurium load resulted in lower (P < 0.05) abundance of genera such as Lactobacillus, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Butyricimonas, Faecalibacterium and Romboutsia suggesting Salmonella driven gut microbiota dysbiosis. Higher Salmonella load led to increased abundance of genera such as Caproiciproducens, Acetanaerobacterium, Akkermansia, Erysipelatoclostridium, Eisenbergiella, EscherichiaShigella and Flavonifractor suggesting a positive interaction of these genera with Salmonella in the displaced gut microbiota. Probiotic supplementation improved the gut microbiota by balancing the abundance of most of the genera displaced by the Salmonella challenge with clearer effects observed with continuous supplementation of the probiotic. The levels of acetate and butyrate in the faeces were not affected (P > 0.05) by Salmonella challenge and the butyrate level was increased by the continuous feeding of the probiotic. Probiotic supplementation in Salmonella challenged chickens resulted in higher level of propionate. Continuous probiotic supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) the overall mean load of Salmonella in faeces and had a significant effect on Salmonella load reduction in internal organs.
Conclusions: Salmonella challenge negatively impacts the diversity and abundance of many gut microbial genera
involved in important functions such as organic acid and vitamin production. Strategic feeding of a Bacillus based
probiotic helps in restoring many of the microbial genera displaced by Salmonella Typhimurium challenge.",PRJNA561675.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/eda348821708952469c2f62d7f39ef87/a5304393/PRJNA561675.pdf),"illumina,16S/ITS Amplicon,Metagenomic",Maria Meza,

There are many factors thatcan cause data variation and inconsistency during the process of microbiota study,
in particular, sample storage conditions and sequencing process. Here, we systemically evaluated the impacts of six fecal sample storage conditions (three non-commercial storage protocols, -80°C, -80°C with 70% ethanol (ET_-80°C), 4°C with 70% ethanol (ET_4°C), and three commercial storage reagents, OMNIgeneGUT OMR-200 (GT) and
MGIEasy (MGIE) at room temperature, and Longsee at 4°C (LS) on gut microbiome profile based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition, we also investigated the impacts of storage periods (1 and 2 weeks, or 6 months) and sequencing platform on microbiome profile. The efficacy of storage conditions was evaluated by DNA yield and quality, a and b diversity, relative abundance of the dominant and functional
bacteria associated with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and BAs metabolism. Our current study suggested that 􀀀80C was acceptable for fecal sample storage, and the addition of 70% ethanol had some benefits in maintaining the microbial community structure. Meanwhile, we found that samples in ET_4°C and GT reagents were comparable, both of them introduced some biases in a or b diversity, and the relative abundance of functional bacteria. Samples stored in MGIE reagent resulted in the least variation, whereas the most obvious variations were introduced by LS reagents. In addition, our results indicated that variations caused by storage condition were larger
than that of storage time and sequencing platform.

B. velezensis FKM10 was previously isolated from rhizosphere soil of apple trees and shows potential as a plant growth-promoting and biocontrol bacterium. In this study, strain FKM10 was verified to inhibit some fungal pathogens of soil-borne plant diseases, produce siderophores to absorb ferric iron for plants, and degrade proteins. Pot experiments showed that the application of strain FKM10 could directly promote the growth of Malus hupehensis Rehd. by increasing biomass, promoting the absorption of nutrients, improving soil fertility, changing the soil microbial community structure, and reducing fungal diversity. The results of this study provided a basis for using strain FKM10 to improve crop yield and overcome diseases of plants. The mechanism of strain FKM10 to control the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides was studied by interoperation with RNA sequencing. Strain FKM10 can destroy the cell wall and cell membrane of F. verticillioides. The secretion of glucosidases, such as β-glucanase, might be one of the causes of the destruction of the fungal cell wall. The regulation of amino acid metabolism might also play an important role in the antibacterial process of strain FKM10. During the antibacterial process, strain FKM10 attacks F. verticillioides and strain FKM10 itself is also affected: the expression of spores is increased, the number of viable cells is decreased, and the ribonucleoprotein complex and flagellar assembly-related genes are downregulated. The results of this study indicate that both strain FKM10 and F. verticillioides have mutually inhibitory activities in a liquid environment. Comparative genome analysis of B. velezensis FKM10 reveals that the general features of their genomes are similar overall and contain the core genome for this species.

Isolation was carried out through enrichment culture, serial dilution and pour plate methods using the petrol supplemented minimal salt media. The isolated bacteria were analyzed to document growth behavior, petrol removal efficiencies, antibiotic resistance profile, and biochemical characteristics. The 16S rRNA based phylogenetic analysis helped to reveal the identity of isolated bacterial species and construct the phylogenetic trees. Total nine bacteria were isolated, out of which three (IUBP2, IUBP3, IUBP5) were identified as Brevibacillus formosus, one (IUBP1) was found similar to Brevibacillus agri, four (IUBP7, IUBP8, IUBP13, and IUBP14) shared homology with Burkholderia lata, and one (IUBP15) with Burkholderia pyrrocinia. All the isolates were fast growing and exhibited considerable petrol degradation potential. The highest petrol removal efficiency (69.5% ± 13.44/6 days) was recorded for the strain IUBP15 at a petrol concentration of 0.1% (v/v). All bacteria studied (100%) were positive for esculinase and phosphatase. Many strains exhibited positive responses for arginine dehydrolase (22%), β-naphthylamidase (11%), β-D-glucosaminide (33%), mannitol (55%), sorbitol (66%) and inulin (88%) fermentation test. While all were sensitive to the antibiotics, some of them were found resistant against chloramphenicol and oxacillin. The remarkable biochemical characteristics and considerable petrol removal potential (40–70%) highlights utilization of the bacteria isolated for petrol bioremediation, mineralization of organophosphates, dairy and food industry, and also as biofertilizers and biocontrol agents.",PRJNA563559.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/053a8b40801ed5aa34bcaa6cb4bc0adc/7f0f96b7/PRJNA563559.pdf),"Metagenomic,illumina",Maria Meza,

However, the underlying mechanism of IBS is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanism and novel biomarkers of IBS through evaluation of the metabolomic and microbiologic profile.

Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 15 irritable bowel syndrome patients and 15 healthy controls. By using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, fecal metabolites and microbiota of healthy controls and the IBS patients were measured.

Results: IBS patients had a significantly differential metabolite profile as compared to healthy controls, and 4 clusters with 31 metabolites, including a group of amino acids and fatty acids, were significantly up-regulated as compared to the healthy controls. In addition, 19 microbes were significantly up-regulated, and 12 microbes were down-regulated in the IBS group, when compared with the healthy controls. Some clusters of fecal metabolites or microorganisms were significantly correlated with the severity of IBS symptoms, such as the frequency of abdominal pain/discomfort and the number of bowel movements. Correlation of the metabolite levels with abundances of microbial genera showed some statistically significant metabolite-microbe associations. Four differentially abundant amino acids clustered together were positively correlated with some microbes, including Lachnospira, Clostridium, and so on.

Conclusion: The finding of this study puts a global perspective on metabolomics and microbiota profiling in IBS patients and provides a theoretical basis for future research on pathophysiology of IBS.",PRJNA563780.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a9a6c828310373eb420b1de3196c69cc/2bc72c40/PRJNA563780.pdf),"Metagenomic,illumina,Metabolomics",Maria Meza,

Performing these services requires a diverse and constantly changing set of metabolic functions from the bacteria in the microbiome. The metabolic repertoire of the microbiome is ultimately dependent on
the outcomes of the ecological interactions of its member microbes, as these interactions in part determine the taxonomic composition of the microbiome. The ecological processes that underpin the microbiome's ability to handle a variety of metabolic challenges might involve rapid turnover of the gut microbiome in response to new metabolic challenges, or it might entail maintaining sufficient diversity in the microbiome that any new metabolic demands can be met from an existing set of bacteria. To differentiate between these scenarios, we examine the gut bacteria and resident eukaryotes of two generalist‐insectivore lizards, while simultaneously identifying the arthropod prey each lizard was digesting at the time of sampling. We find that the
cohorts of bacteria that occur significantly more or less often than expected with arthropod diet items or eukaryotes include bacterial species that are highly similar to each other metabolically.

The goals of the present study were to establish a baseline dataset of microbial communities associated with the tissues of wild marine fish, in order to examine species‐specific microbial characteristics and to screen for candidate pathogens. This issue is especially relevant due to the development of mariculture farms and the possible transmission of pathogens from wild to farmed fish and vice versa. Although fish were apparently healthy, 16S rRNA NGS screening identified three potential fish bacterial pathogens: Photobacterium damselae, Vibrio harveyi and Streptococcus iniae . Based on the distribution patterns and relative abundance, 16 samples were classified as potential pathogenic bacteria‐infected samples (PPBIS). Hence, PPBIS prevalence was significantly higher in kidneys than in liver samples and variation was found between the fish species.

Here, we conducted a metagenomic exploration of planktonic dsDNA prokaryotic viruses by sequencing both virion (<0.22 μm) and cellular (0.22–5.0 μm) fractions collected spatiotemporally from a deep freshwater lake (Lake Biwa, Japan). This simultaneously reconstructed 183 complete (i.e., circular) viral genomes and 57 bacterioplankton metagenome‐assembled genomes. Analysis of metagenomic read coverage revealed vertical partitioning of the viral community analogous to the vertically stratified bacterioplankton community. The hypolimnetic community was generally stable during stratification, but occasionally shifted abruptly, presumably due to lysogenic induction. Genes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction were encoded in 20 (10.9%) viral genomes, including those of dominant viruses, and may aid viral propagation in sulfur‐limited freshwater systems. Hosts were predicted for 40 (21.9%) viral genomes, encompassing 10 phyla (or classes of Proteobacteria) including ubiquitous freshwater bacterioplankton lineages (e.g., Ca . Fonsibacter and Ca . Nitrosoarchaeum). Comparison with viral genomes derived from published metagenomes revealed viral phylogeographic connectivity in geographically isolated habitats.

Fruit flies in the Tephritidae family have economic importance at the global level, including species such as Anastrepha obliqua, which is an important pest in the neotropical region. Although several studies have been performed on the microbiota associated with fruit flies, there are still large gaps in our knowledge about the bacterial communities on
the genus Anastrepha. During this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the bacterial communities of the polyphagous fly A. obliqua, and we evaluated the effect of the life stage (larvae and adults) and host plant (three plant species) on the structure of these communities. Our results show that the bacterial communities in A. obliqua appears to be structured according to the insect life stage and the host plant. The predominant genera belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were Wolbachia and Enterobacter in both larvae and adults, and they displayed differences in abundance between them, with Wolbachia sp. being more abundant in larvae and Enterobacter sp. being more abundant in adults. Differences in
the structures of the bacterial communities were also observed according to the host plant with higher abundance of Enterobacter
and Acetobacter bacteria in mango and plum fruits. Based on our results, it can be hypothesized that the bacterial communities on A. obliqua reorganize according to the needs of these insects during their different life stages and could also play an important role in the establishment of this fly species on different host plants.

Primers for the detection of chicken enteric viruses were designed from the sequencing data obtained with metagenomics. Multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR were performed to detect a variety of etiological agents previously described in natural cases of RSS.

Results
The most abundant viral families identified in this study were Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae and Picobirnaviridae. Chicken astrovirus sequences were present in all four samples, suggesting an association between chicken astrovirus and RSS and chicken astrovirus as a candidate pathogen responsible for RSS. Picobirnavirus and the newly identified chapparvovirus were found in chickens in the Republic of Korea for the first time, and the genetic diversity of enteric viruses and viral communities was showed.

Conclusions
Chicken astrovirus was consistently detected in broilers affected with RSS and the result of this study may contribute to knowledge of enteric diseases and viruses in chickens.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The combination of extreme temperature and chemical conditions encountered in geothermal environments often results in considerably less microbial diversity than other terrestrial habitats and offers a tremendous opportunity for studying the structure and function of indigenous microbial communities and for establishing linkages between putative metabolisms and element cycling. Metagenome sequence (14–15,000 Sanger reads per site) was obtained for five high-temperature (>65°C) chemotrophic microbial communities sampled from geothermal springs (or pools) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) that exhibit a wide range in geochemistry including pH, dissolved sulfide, dissolved oxygen and ferrous iron. Metagenome data revealed significant differences in the predominant phyla associated with each of these geochemical environments. Novel members of the Sulfolobales are dominant in low pH environments, while other Crenarchaeota including distantly-related Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales populations dominate in suboxic sulfidic sediments. Several novel archaeal groups are well represented in an acidic (pH 3) Fe-oxyhydroxide mat, where a higher O2 influx is accompanied with an increase in archaeal diversity. The presence or absence of genes and pathways important in S oxidation-reduction, H2-oxidation, and aerobic respiration (terminal oxidation) provide insight regarding the metabolic strategies of indigenous organisms present in geothermal systems. Multiple-pathway and protein-specific functional analysis of metagenome sequence data corroborated results from phylogenetic analyses and clearly demonstrate major differences in metabolic potential across sites. The distribution of functional genes involved in electron transport is consistent with the hypothesis that geochemical parameters (e.g., pH, sulfide, Fe, O2) control microbial community structure and function in YNP geothermal springs.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Microbial life dominates the earth, but many species are difficult or even impossible to study under laboratory conditions. Sequencing DNA directly from the environment, a technique commonly referred to as metagenomics, is an important tool for cataloging microbial life. This culture-independent approach involves collecting samples that include microbes in them, extracting DNA from the samples, and sequencing the DNA. A sample may contain many different microorganisms, macroorganisms, and even free-floating environmental DNA. A fundamental challenge in metagenomics has been estimating the abundance of organisms in a sample based on the frequency with which the organism's DNA was observed in reads generated via DNA sequencing.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We created mixtures of ten microbial species for which genome sequences are known. Each mixture contained an equal number of cells of each species. We then extracted DNA from the mixtures, sequenced the DNA, and measured the frequency with which genomic regions from each organism was observed in the sequenced DNA. We found that the observed frequency of reads mapping to each organism did not reflect the equal numbers of cells that were known to be included in each mixture. The relative organism abundances varied significantly depending on the DNA extraction and sequencing protocol utilized.

Conclusions/Significance
We describe a new data resource for measuring the accuracy of metagenomic binning methods, created by in vitro-simulation of a metagenomic community. Our in vitro simulation can be used to complement previous in silico benchmark studies. In constructing a synthetic community and sequencing its metagenome, we encountered several sources of observation bias that likely affect most metagenomic experiments to date and present challenges for comparative metagenomic studies. DNA preparation methods have a particularly profound effect in our study, implying that samples prepared with different protocols are not suitable for comparative metagenomics.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Here we explore the effect of salinity on amino acid preference on an environmental scale. Via pyrosequencing, we have obtained two distinct metagenomic data sets from the Dead Sea, one from a 1992 archaeal bloom and one from the modern Dead Sea. Our data, along with metagenomes from environments representing a range of salinities, show a strong linear correlation (R 2 = 0.97) between the salinity of an environment and the ratio of acidic to basic amino acids encoded by its inhabitants. Using the amino acid composition of putative protein‐encoding reads and the results of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we differentiate recovered sequences representing microorganisms indigenous to the Dead Sea from lateral gene transfer events and foreign DNA. Our methods demonstrate lateral gene transfer events between a halophilic archaeon and relatives of the thermophilic bacterial genus Thermotoga and suggest the presence of indigenous Dead Sea representatives from 10 traditionally non‐hyperhalophilic bacterial lineages. The work suggests the possibility that amino acid bias of hypersaline environments might be preservable in fossil DNA or fossil amino acids, serving as a proxy for the salinity of an ancient environment. Finally, both the amino acid profile of the 2007 Dead Sea metagenome and the V9 amplicon library support the conclusion that the dominant microorganism inhabiting the Dead Sea is most closely related to a thus far uncultured relative of an alkaliphilic haloarchaeon.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

This reservoir of C is vulnerable to decomposition as rising global temperatures cause the permafrost to thaw2. During thaw, trapped organic matter may become more accessible for microbial degradation and result in greenhouse gas emissions4,5. Despite recent advances in the use of molecular tools to study permafrost microbial communities6,7,8,9, their response to thaw remains unclear. Here we use deep metagenomic sequencing to determine the impact of thaw on microbial phylogenetic and functional genes, and relate these data to measurements of methane emissions. Metagenomics, the direct sequencing of DNA from the environment, allows the examination of whole biochemical pathways and associated processes, as opposed to individual pieces of the metabolic puzzle. Our metagenome analyses reveal that during transition from a frozen to a thawed state there are rapid shifts in many microbial, phylogenetic and functional gene abundances and pathways. After one week of incubation at 5 °C, permafrost metagenomes converge to be more similar to each other than while they are frozen. We find that multiple genes involved in cycling of C and nitrogen shift rapidly during thaw. We also construct the first draft genome from a complex soil metagenome, which corresponds to a novel methanogen. Methane previously accumulated in permafrost is released during thaw and subsequently consumed by methanotrophic bacteria. Together these data point towards the importance of rapid cycling of methane and nitrogen in thawing permafrost.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Many countries are promoting the use of alternative energy sources for sustainable energy production. In this study, a metagenome from a production-scale biogas fermenter was analysed employing Roche's GS FLX Titanium technology and compared to a previous dataset obtained from the same community DNA sample that was sequenced on the GS FLX platform. Taxonomic profiling based on 16S rRNA-specific sequences and an Environmental Gene Tag (EGT) analysis employing CARMA demonstrated that both approaches benefit from the longer read lengths obtained on the Titanium platform. Results confirmed Clostridia as the most prevalent taxonomic class, whereas species of the order Methanomicrobiales are dominant among methanogenic Archaea. However, the analyses also identified additional taxa that were missed by the previous study, including members of the genera Streptococcus, Acetivibrio, Garciella, Tissierella, and Gelria, which might also play a role in the fermentation process leading to the formation of methane. Taking advantage of the CARMA feature to correlate taxonomic information of sequences with their assigned functions, it appeared that Firmicutes, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, dominate within the functional context of polysaccharide degradation whereas Methanomicrobiales represent the most abundant taxonomic group responsible for methane production. Clostridia is the most important class involved in the reductive CoA pathway (Wood-Ljungdahl pathway) that is characteristic for acetogenesis. Based on binning of 16S rRNA-specific sequences allocated to the dominant genus Methanoculleus, it could be shown that this genus is represented by several different species. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences placed them in close proximity to the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus bourgensis. While rarefaction analyses still indicate incomplete coverage, examination of the GS FLX Titanium dataset resulted in the identification of additional genera and functional elements, providing a far more complete coverage of the community involved in anaerobic fermentative pathways leading to methane formation.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Koshiq Hossain,

Anaerobic digestion has been widely applied to treat the waste activated sludge from biological wastewater treatment and produce methane for biofuel, which has been one of the most efficient solutions to both energy crisis and environmental pollution challenges. Anaerobic digestion sludge contains highly complex microbial communities, which play crucial roles in sludge treatment. However, traditional approaches based on 16S rRNA amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization cannot completely reveal the whole microbial community structure due to the extremely high complexity of the involved communities. In this sense, the next-generation high-throughput sequencing provides a powerful tool for dissecting microbial community structure and methane-producing pathways in anaerobic digestion.

Results
In this work, the metagenomic sequencing was used to characterize microbial community structure of the anaerobic digestion sludge from a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant. Over 3.0 gigabases of metagenomic sequence data were generated with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Taxonomic analysis by MG-RAST server indicated that overall bacteria were dominant (~93%) whereas a considerable abundance of archaea (~6%) were also detected in the anaerobic digestion sludge. The most abundant bacterial populations were found to be Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Key microorganisms and related pathways involved in methanogenesis were further revealed. The dominant proliferation of Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, together with the functional affiliation of enzymes-encoding genes (acetate kinase (AckA), phosphate acetyltransferase (PTA), and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS)), suggested that the acetoclastic methanogenesis is the dominant methanogenesis pathway in the full-scale anaerobic digester.

Conclusions
In short, the metagenomic sequencing study of this work successfully dissected the detail microbial community structure and the dominated methane-producing pathways of a full-scale anaerobic digester. The knowledge garnered would facilitate to develop more efficient full-scale anaerobic digestion systems to achieve high-rate waste sludge treatment and methane production.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Data from small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene libraries and direct pyrosequencing of the same samples indicated that Gamma- and Alpha-proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes, dominated the bacterial fraction in Marmara deep-sea plankton, whereas Planctomycetes, Delta- and Gamma-proteobacteria were the most abundant groups in high bacterial-diversity sediment. Group I Crenarchaeota/Thaumarchaeota dominated the archaeal plankton fraction, although group II and III Euryarchaeota were also present. Eukaryotes were highly diverse in SSU rRNA gene libraries, with group I (Duboscquellida) and II (Syndiniales) alveolates and Radiozoa dominating plankton, and Opisthokonta and Alveolates, sediment. However, eukaryotic sequences were scarce in pyrosequence data. Archaeal amo genes were abundant in plankton, suggesting that Marmara planktonic Thaumarchaeota are ammonia oxidizers. Genes involved in sulfate reduction, carbon monoxide oxidation, anammox and sulfatases were over-represented in sediment. Genome recruitment analyses showed that Alteromonas macleodii 'surface ecotype', Pelagibacter ubique and Nitrosopumilus maritimus were highly represented in 1000 m-deep plankton. A comparative analysis of Marmara metagenomes with ALOHA deep-sea and surface plankton, whale carcasses, Peru subsurface sediment and soil metagenomes clustered deep-sea Marmara plankton with deep-ALOHA plankton and whale carcasses, likely because of the suboxic conditions in the deep Marmara water column.

A total of 182 560 sequences from the V6 hyper‐variable region of the small‐subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) were obtained; there were between 11 327 and 17 339 reads per sample. Approximately 7000 genera were identified, with one in every 25 reads being attributed to a new genus; yet this level of sampling far from exhausted the total diversity present at any one time point.

The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria ( 50% of all sequenced reads), while the SAR11 clade comprised 21% of the ubiquitous reads and ∼12% of the total sequenced reads. In contrast, 78% of all operational taxonomic units were only found at one time point and 67% were only found once, evidence of a large and transient rare assemblage.

Casamayor",Applied and Environmental Microbiology,"Water Microbiology,water pollution,Sequence Classification,Search Algorithm",https://aem.asm.org/content/77/6/1937,,"The annual changes in the composition and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were analyzed monthly in surface waters of three high mountain lakes within the Limnological Observatory of the Pyrenees (LOOP; northeast Spain) using both 16S rRNA and functional (ammonia monooxygenase gene, amoA) gene sequencing as well as quantitative PCR amplification. The set of biological data was related to changes in nitrogen species and to other relevant environmental variables. The whole archaeal assemblage was dominated by phylotypes closely related to the crenarchaeal 1.1a group (58% ± 18% of total 16S rRNA gene sequences), and consistent structural changes were detected during the study. Water temperature was the environmental variable that better explained spring, summer, and winter (ice-covered lakes) archaeal assemblage structure. The amoA gene was detected year round, and seasonal changes in amoA gene composition were well correlated with changes in the archaeal 16S rRNA gene pool. In addition, copy numbers of both the specific 1.1a group 16 rRNA and archaeal amoA genes were well correlated, suggesting that most freshwater 1.1a Crenarchaeota had the potential to carry out ammonia oxidation. Seasonal changes in the diversity and abundance of AOA (i.e., amoA) were better explained by temporal changes in ammonium, the substrate for nitrification, and mostly nitrite, the product of ammonia oxidation. Lacustrine amoA gene sequences grouped in coherent freshwater phylogenetic clusters, suggesting that freshwater habitats harbor typical amoA-containing ecotypes, which is different from soils and seas. We observed within the freshwater amoA gene sequence pool a high genetic divergence (translating to up to 32% amino acid divergence) between the spring and the remaining AOA assemblages. This suggests that different AOA ecotypes are adapted to different temporal ecological niches in these lakes.

For almost 30 years, the ubiquity of nitrification, particularly in the most oligotrophic environments, had constituted an enigma for ecologists (28, 52). First, because of very low natural abundances of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), the a priori unique microorganisms with the potential to catalyze the first step of nitrification had been reported (e.g., 0.1% of total bacterial assemblage in oceanic habitats) (9, 38), and second, because field measurements indicated that the oxidation of ammonia (NH4+) to nitrate was feasible in situ even in the most oligotrophic habitats, where NH4+ concentrations were below the affinity threshold for AOB (8). Five years ago, metagenomics provided an answer to the enigma and radically changed the general perception of the nitrification process (65, 67). The presence of putative ammonia monooxygenase subunits (amoA, amoB, and amoC) within the genomes of widespread and abundant microorganisms of the domain Archaea (65, 67), as well as the chemolithoautotrophic growth using ammonia as an energy source observed in the recently isolated Crenarchaeota Nitrosopumilus maritimus (37), has fuelled the research on the role of archaea in the global nitrogen cycle. Recent studies have shown the dominance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) over AOB in most natural habitats (29, 39, 40, 51, 68). This suggests a pivotal role of archaea in nitrification, particularly in oligotrophic environments (47).

PCR-based amoA gene surveys have revealed the ubiquity of AOA in natural habitats (see recent reviews in references 21 and 56) and have quickly expanded the shape of the archaeal amoA phylogenetic tree (56). However, most studies focused on marine samples, sediments, or soils, whereas freshwater habitats have remained poorly explored. Interestingly, freshwater habitats recently have been identified as one of the largest reservoirs of archaeal genetic diversity (3, 43). So far, the few studies that have investigated the environmental factors shaping the diversity of amoA genes in oceans, sediments, and soils have indentified pH (51), salinity (49), fertilization regimen (29, 61), and nitrite levels (58) as key environmental parameters for AOA.

In the present work, we have studied seasonal changes in environmental parameters and changes in the genetic composition and abundance of freshwater AOA in a few selected high-altitude lakes. These remote lakes are very poor in nutrients and are characterized by a large variability in both the concentration and the distribution of the different N oxidation states that are not directly related to general limnological parameters (physical and chemical). In these lakes, atmospheric deposition represents the main source of nitrogen (15). These features and previous observations of the changes in dissolved organic nitrogen associated with high microbial activities (15) suggest strong interactions between microbial communities and the nitrogen cycle. Recently, Crenarchaeota closely related to the ammonia-oxidizing 1.1a group have been detected in the surface of these lakes (4). Thus, these lakes are very convenient model systems to explore the dynamics of archaeal diversity and abundance related to N biogeochemistry.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

A timely question is this: What additional insights about the microbial diversity present within a body habit are obtained with deeper sequencing? Moreover, how much of the observed organismal diversity is an artifact of noise introduced during PCR and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes (1–3)? Therefore, in the current study we use a variety of experimental and computational approaches to explore the level of diversity and interpersonal variation in bacterial phylotypes, microbial genes, and their expressed mRNA transcripts within the human gut, home to our largest community of microorganisms.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Phenotypic differences, predicted to result from divergent lysogenic-lytic switch mechanisms, are evident between these lysogens, with CB-A displaying a higher incidence of spontaneous induction. Doubling times of CB-D and CB-A in liquid culture are 75 and 100 min, respectively. As cell cultures enter stationary phase, CB-A viable counts are half of CB-D.

Six healthy adult dogs were used in a crossover design and fed a low-fiber control diet (K9C) or one containing 7.5% beet pulp (K9BP). Pooled fecal DNA samples from each treatment were subjected to 454 pyrosequencing, generating 503 280 (K9C) and 505 061 (K9BP) sequences. Dominant bacterial phyla included the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes, both of which comprised ∼35% of all sequences, followed by Proteobacteria (13–15%) and Fusobacteria (7–8%). K9C had a greater percentage of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, whereas K9BP had greater proportions of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes. Archaea were not altered by diet and represented ∼1% of all sequences. All archaea were members of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, with methanogens being the most abundant and diverse. Three fungi phylotypes were present in K9C, but none in K9BP. Less than 0.4% of sequences were of viral origin, with >99% of them associated with bacteriophages. Primary functional categories were not significantly affected by diet and were associated with carbohydrates; protein metabolism; DNA metabolism; cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments; amino acids and derivatives; cell wall and capsule; and virulence. Hierarchical clustering of several gastrointestinal metagenomes demonstrated phylogenetic and metabolic similarity between dogs, humans and mice. More research is required to provide deeper coverage of the canine microbiome, evaluate effects of age, genetics or environment on its composition and activity, and identify its role in gastrointestinal disease.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

A balanced microbiome stimulates the immune system, aids in the competitive exclusion of transient pathogens and provides nutritional benefits to the host. With recent rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technology, molecular approaches have become the routinely used tools for ecological studies of the feline microbiome, and have revealed a highly diverse and complex intestinal ecosystem in the feline GI tract. The major bacterial groups are similar to those found in other mammals, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria constituting more than 99% of intestinal microbiota. Several nutritional studies have demonstrated that the feline microbiota can be modulated by the amount of soluble fibers (i.e., prebiotics) and macronutrients (i.e., protein content) in the diet. Initial clinical studies have suggested the presence of a dysbiosis in feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recently, metagenomic approaches have attempted to characterize the microbial gene pool.

In the present study, we identified the partial dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) sequences in mosquitoes. Metagenomic analysis and the PCR amplification revealed three DENV sequences, one of which encodes a partial envelope protein. Two ZIKV sequences both encoding partial nonstructural protein 3 and one JEV sequence encoding the complete envelope protein were identified. There was variability in the viral titers of the newly isolated virus JEV-China/YN2016-1 of different passage viruses.

Insight into Dominant Cellulolytic Bacteria from Two Biogas Digesters and Their Glycoside Hydrolase Genes,PRJNA50503,12/6/2015,"Yongjun Wei,Xing Yan","Yongjun Wei ,Haokui Zhou ,Jun Zhang,Lei Zhang,Alei Geng,Fanghua Liu,Guoping Zhao,Shengyue Wang,Zhihua Zhou  ,Xing Yan ",Plos One,"16S RNA,16S rRNA,16S Samples,DNA",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?i=10.1371/journal.pone.0129921,,"Diverse cellulolytic bacteria are essential for maintaining high lignocellulose degradation ability in biogas digesters. However, little was known about functional genes and gene clusters of dominant cellulolytic bacteria in biogas digesters. This is the foundation to understand lignocellulose degradation mechanisms of biogas digesters and apply these gene resource for optimizing biofuel production. A combination of metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene clone library methods was used to investigate the dominant cellulolytic bacteria and their glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes in two biogas digesters. The 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that the dominant cellulolytic bacteria were strains closely related to Clostridium straminisolvens and an uncultured cellulolytic bacterium designated BG-1. To recover GH genes from cellulolytic bacteria in general, and BG-1 in particular, a refined assembly approach developed in this study was used to assemble GH genes from metagenomic reads; 163 GH-containing contigs ≥ 1 kb in length were obtained. Six recovered GH5 genes that were expressed in E. coli demonstrated multiple lignocellulase activities and one had high mannanase activity (1255 U/mg). Eleven fosmid clones harboring the recovered GH-containing contigs were sequenced and assembled into 10 fosmid contigs. The composition of GH genes in the 163 assembled metagenomic contigs and 10 fosmid contigs indicated that diverse GHs and lignocellulose degradation mechanisms were present in the biogas digesters. In particular, a small portion of BG-1 genome information was recovered by PhyloPythiaS analysis. The lignocellulase gene clusters in BG-1 suggested that it might use a possible novel lignocellulose degradation mechanism to efficiently degrade lignocellulose. Dominant cellulolytic bacteria of biogas digester possess diverse GH genes, not only in sequences but also in their functions, which may be applied for production of biofuel in the future.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Koshiq Hossain,

Coincident with this timing, the bacterioplankton respond with significant increases in secondary productivity. Little is known about bacterioplankton in winter when darkness and sea-ice cover inhibit photoautotrophic primary production. We report here an environmental genomic and small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) analysis of winter and summer Antarctic Peninsula coastal seawater bacterioplankton. Intense inter-seasonal differences were reflected through shifts in community composition and functional capacities encoded in winter and summer environmental genomes with significantly higher phylogenetic and functional diversity in winter. In general, inferred metabolisms of summer bacterioplankton were characterized by chemoheterotrophy, photoheterotrophy and aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis while the winter community included the capacity for bacterial and archaeal chemolithoautotrophy. Chemolithoautotrophic pathways were dominant in winter and were similar to those recently reported in global ‘dark ocean’ mesopelagic waters. If chemolithoautotrophy is widespread in the Southern Ocean in winter, this process may be a previously unaccounted carbon sink and may help account for the unexplained anomalies in surface inorganic nitrogen content.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

However, much of the microbial diversity in marine ecosystems with its potential for uncovering new antimicrobial compounds remains to be discovered. This is particularly true for surface-attached marine bacteria, which comprise microbial communities that are generally unique to a host surface and geographic location. The current study characterises culturable microbial communities on marine surfaces from Sydney Harbour, Australia, and tests their antimicrobial activities. A high proportion (47%) of the 104 marine isolates from Sydney Harbour could not be classified to a known genus based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Assays of antimicrobial activity from the 104 isolates showed that antimicrobial production is not widespread throughout the phylogeny of isolates with 8 of the 10 antimicrobial producers clustering into a distinct phylogenetic clade. These 8 closely related antibacterial isolates had potent activity in antibacterial cross-dilution assays, with no growth of target bacteria at supernatant concentrations of less than 6.6 % v/v. To gain an insight into the types of molecules responsible for this potent activity, differential polarity extractions were carried out on antibacterial culture supernatants from these 8 isolates. All of the activity fractionated into the most polar phase, suggesting that the antibacterial molecules are highly polar. Proteolytic digestion inhibited activity, indicating that the antibacterial molecules were proteins. This study is the first to link the phylogeny of numerous surface-attached marine bacteria with antimicrobial production.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Koshiq Hossain,

Thus, to investigate the distribution of sufolipid biosynthesis pathways in Spirulina, a genetic screening/phylogentic study was performed. Five different strains of Spirulina [Spirulina (Jiangmen), Spirulina sp., S. platensis, S. maxima, and Spirulina seawater] sourced from different locations were initially classified via 16S rDNA sequencing, and then screened for the presence of the sulfolipid biosynthesis genes sqdB and sqdX via a PCR. To assess the suitability of these strains for human consumption and safe therapeutic use, the strains were also screened for the presence of genes encoding nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are often associated with toxin pathways in cyanobacteria. The results of the 16S rDNA analysis and phylogenetic study indicated that Spirulina sp. is closely related to Halospirulina, whereas the other four Spirulina strains are closely related to Arthrospira. Homologs of sqdB and sqdX were identified in Spirulina (Jiangmen), Spirulina sp., S. platensis, and the Spirulina seawater. None of the Spirulina strains screened in this study tested positive for NRPS or PKS genes, suggesting that these strains do not produce NRP or PK toxins.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Koshiq Hossain,

Temperate freshwater lakes such as Lake Lanier are underrepresented among the growing number of environmental metagenomic data sets, and little is known about how functional gene content in freshwater communities relates to that of other ecosystems. To better characterize the gene content and variability of this freshwater planktonic microbial community, we sequenced several samples obtained around a strong summer storm event and during the fall water mixing using a random whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach. Comparative metagenomics revealed that the gene content was relatively stable over time and more related to that of another freshwater lake and the surface ocean than to soil. However, the phylogenetic diversity of Lake Lanier communities was distinct from that of soil and marine communities. We identified several important genomic adaptations that account for these findings, such as the use of potassium (as opposed to sodium) osmoregulators by freshwater organisms and differences in the community average genome size. We show that the lake community is predominantly composed of sequence-discrete populations and describe a simple method to assess community complexity based on population richness and evenness and to determine the sequencing effort required to cover diversity in a sample. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and metabolic potential of a temperate planktonic freshwater community and advances approaches for comparative metagenomics.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Using a metagenomic approach, a total of 52, 53, 14 and 12 distinct species (according to operational phylogenetic units (OPU) in our work equivalent to taxonomic species) were identified in the N, Nbs, CN1 and CN2 communities, respectively. Approximately 10 out of 95 distinct species and 238 out of 3293 clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) protein families identified were clearly stimulated under the assayed conditions, whereas only two species and 1465 COGs conformed to the common set in all of the mesocosms. Results indicated distinct biodegradation capabilities for the utilisation of potential growth-supporting aromatics, which results in bio-stimulated communities being extremely fit to naphthalene utilisation and non-stimulated communities exhibiting a greater metabolic window than previously predicted. On the basis of comparing protein expression profiles and metagenome data sets, inter-alia interactions among members were hypothesised.

Moran",PNAS,"Diversity,Gut Microbiome,gut microbiota,gut metagenome",https://www.pnas.org/content/109/27/11002,,"Animals living in social communities typically harbor a characteristic gut microbiota important for nutrition and pathogen defense. Accordingly, in the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, a distinctive microbial community, composed of a taxonomically restricted set of species specific to social bees, has been identified. Despite the ecological and economical importance of honey bees and the increasing concern about population declines, the role of their gut symbionts for colony health and nutrition is unknown. Here, we sequenced the metagenome of the gut microbiota of honey bees. Unexpectedly, we found a remarkable degree of genetic diversity within the few bacterial species colonizing the bee gut. Comparative analysis of gene contents suggests that different species harbor distinct functional capabilities linked to host interaction, biofilm formation, and carbohydrate breakdown. Whereas the former two functions could be critical for pathogen defense and immunity, the latter one might assist nutrient utilization. In a γ-proteobacterial species, we identified genes encoding pectin-degrading enzymes likely involved in the breakdown of pollen walls. Experimental investigation showed that this activity is restricted to a subset of strains of this species providing evidence for niche specialization. Long-standing association of these gut symbionts with their hosts, favored by the eusocial lifestyle of honey bees, might have promoted the genetic and functional diversification of these bee-specific bacteria. Besides revealing insights into mutualistic functions governed by the microbiota of this important pollinator, our findings indicate that the honey bee can serve as a model for understanding more complex gut-associated microbial communities.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Those affected with this illness develop diarrhea and emesis within 2–20 hours after a meal including raw fish. No known causative agents such as bacteria, viruses, bacterial toxins, or toxic chemicals have been detected in the foods that were ingested. Fortunately, this illness is self-limiting with good prognosis in all cases.

Methods. We conducted an epidemiological analysis of outbreaks that occurred during 2008 and 2010 and analysed a fish sample from one outbreak by metagenomic DNA sequencing, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and direct microscopic observations. The pathogenicity of a putative risk factor identified by these techniques was assessed using the suckling-mouse test and a house musk shrew emetic assay.

Results. The epidemiological analysis of outbreaks in 24 municipalities involving >1300 subjects implicated an olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) as the causative food source. The presence of Kudoa septempunctata, a recently-described myxosporean species in P. olivaceus, was prevalent in the causative foods. K. septempunctata induced watery stools and an elevated fluid accumulation ratio in suckling mice, as well as vomiting in house musk shrews.

Conclusions. These results identify K. septempunctata as the etiological agent of this novel food-borne illness outbreak associated with consumption of raw P. olivaceus. This is the first report, to our knowledge, demonstrating the human pathogenicity of Kudoa spores.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

As a model system for developing a meta-omic approach to identify and characterize natural product pathways from invertebrate-derived microbial consortia, we chose to investigate the ET-743 (Yondelis) biosynthetic pathway. This molecule is an approved anticancer agent obtained in low abundance (10(-4)-10(-5) % w/w) from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata and is generated in suitable quantities for clinical use by a lengthy semisynthetic process. On the basis of structural similarities to three bacterial secondary metabolites, we hypothesized that ET-743 is the product of a marine bacterial symbiont. Using metagenomic sequencing of total DNA from the tunicate/microbial consortium, we targeted and assembled a 35 kb contig containing 25 genes that comprise the core of the NRPS biosynthetic pathway for this valuable anticancer agent. Rigorous sequence analysis based on codon usage of two large unlinked contigs suggests that Candidatus Endoecteinascidia frumentensis produces the ET-743 metabolite. Subsequent metaproteomic analysis confirmed expression of three key biosynthetic proteins. Moreover, the predicted activity of an enzyme for assembly of the tetrahydroisoquinoline core of ET-743 was verified in vitro. This work provides a foundation for direct production of the drug and new analogues through metabolic engineering. We expect that the interdisciplinary approach described is applicable to diverse host-symbiont systems that generate valuable natural products for drug discovery and development.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Here we investigated the impact of the oil on the microbial composition in beach samples collected in June 2010 along a heavily impacted shoreline near Grand Isle, Louisiana. Successional changes in the microbial community structure due to the oil contamination were determined by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Metatranscriptomics was used to determine expression of functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation processes. In addition, potential hydrocarbon-degrading Bacteria were obtained in culture. The 16S data revealed that highly contaminated samples had higher abundances of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria sequences. Successional changes in these classes were observed over time, during which the oil was partially degraded. The metatranscriptome data revealed that PAH, n-alkane, and toluene degradation genes were expressed in the contaminated samples, with high homology to genes from Alteromonadales, Rhodobacterales, and Pseudomonales. Notably, Marinobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) had the highest representation of expressed genes in the samples. A Marinobacter isolated from this beach was shown to have potential for transformation of hydrocarbons in incubation experiments with oil obtained from the Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (MC252) well; collected during the Deepwater Horizon spill.

On site bioremediation of contaminated soil is the only feasible clean up solution in these remote areas, but degradation rates vary widely between bioremediation treatments. Most previous studies have focused on the feasibility of on site clean-up and very little attention has been given to the microbial and functional communities involved and their ecology. Here, we ask the question: which microorganisms and functional genes are abundant and active during hydrocarbon degradation at cold temperature? To answer this question, we sequenced the soil metagenome of an ongoing bioremediation project in Alert, Canada through a time course. We also used reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) to quantify the expression of several hydrocarbon-degrading genes. Pseudomonas species appeared as the most abundant organisms in Alert soils right after contamination with diesel and excavation (t = 0) and one month after the start of the bioremediation treatment (t = 1m), when degradation rates were at their highest, but decreased after one year (t = 1y), when residual soil hydrocarbons were almost depleted. This trend was also reflected in hydrocarbon degrading genes, which were mainly affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria at t = 0 and t = 1m and with Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria at t = 1y. RT-qPCR assays confirmed that Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus species actively expressed hydrocarbon degradation genes in Arctic biopile soils. Taken together, these results indicated that biopile treatment leads to major shifts in soil microbial communities, favoring aerobic bacteria that can degrade hydrocarbons.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The impact of such antibiotic use on the treatment of human diseases is hotly debated. We raised pigs in a highly controlled environment, with one portion of the littermates receiving a diet containing performance-enhancing antibiotics [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin (known as ASP250)] and the other portion receiving the same diet but without the antibiotics. We used phylogenetic, metagenomic, and quantitative PCR-based approaches to address the impact of antibiotics on the swine gut microbiota. Bacterial phylotypes shifted after 14 d of antibiotic treatment, with the medicated pigs showing an increase in Proteobacteria (1–11%) compared with nonmedicated pigs at the same time point. This shift was driven by an increase in Escherichia coli populations. Analysis of the metagenomes showed that microbial functional genes relating to energy production and conversion were increased in the antibiotic-fed pigs. The results also indicate that antibiotic resistance genes increased in abundance and diversity in the medicated swine microbiome despite a high background of resistance genes in nonmedicated swine. Some enriched genes, such as aminoglycoside O-phosphotransferases, confer resistance to antibiotics that were not administered in this study, demonstrating the potential for indirect selection of resistance to classes of antibiotics not fed. The collateral effects of feeding subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics to agricultural animals are apparent and must be considered in cost-benefit analyses.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

In this study, the genomes of three novel Yellowstone Lake virophages (YSLVs)—YSLV5, YSLV6, and YSLV7—were identified from Yellowstone Lake through metagenomic analyses. The relative abundance of these three novel virophages and previously identified Yellowstone Lake virophages YSLV1 to -4 were determined in different locations of the lake, revealing that most of the sampled locations in the lake, including both mesophilic and thermophilic habitats, had multiple virophage genotypes. This likely reflects the diverse habitats or diversity of the eukaryotic hosts and their associated giant viruses that serve as putative hosts for these virophages. YSLV5 has a 29,767-bp genome with 32 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), YSLV6 has a 24,837-bp genome with 29 predicted ORFs, and YSLV7 has a 23,193-bp genome with 26 predicted ORFs. Based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis, YSLV6 shows a close evolutionary relationship with YSLV1 to -4, whereas YSLV5 and YSLV7 are distantly related to the others, and YSLV7 represents the fourth novel virophage lineage. In addition, the genome of YSLV5 has a G+C content of 51.1% that is much higher than all other known virophages, indicating a unique host range for YSLV5. These results suggest that virophages are abundant and have diverse genotypes that likely mirror diverse giant viral and eukaryotic hosts within the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem.

IMPORTANCE This study discovered novel virophages present within the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem using a conserved major capsid protein as a phylogenetic anchor for assembly of sequence reads from Yellowstone Lake metagenomic samples. The three novel virophage genomes (YSLV5 to -7) were completed by identifying specific environmental samples containing these respective virophages, and closing gaps by targeted PCR and sequencing. Most of the YSLV genotypes were associated primarily with photic-zone and nonhydrothermal samples; however, YSLV5 had a unique distribution with an occurrence in vent samples similar to that in photic-zone samples and with a higher GC content that suggests a distinct host and habitat compared to other YSLVs. In addition, genome content and phylogenetic analyses indicate that YSLV5 and YSLV7 are distinct from known virophages and that additional as-yet-uncharacterized virophages are likely present within the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Here, we describe the characterization of these extinct hominids from a new perspective, based on the development of a Neanderthal metagenomic library and its high-throughput sequencing and analysis. Several lines of evidence indicate that the 65,250 base pairs of hominid sequence so far identified in the library are of Neanderthal origin, the strongest being the ascertainment of sequence identities between Neanderthal and chimpanzee at sites where the human genomic sequence is different. These results enabled us to calculate the human-Neanderthal divergence time based on multiple randomly distributed autosomal loci. Our analyses suggest that on average the Neanderthal genomic sequence we obtained and the reference human genome sequence share a most recent common ancestor approximately 706,000 years ago, and that the human and Neanderthal ancestral populations split approximately 370,000 years ago, before the emergence of anatomically modern humans. Our finding that the Neanderthal and human genomes are at least 99.5% identical led us to develop and successfully implement a targeted method for recovering specific ancient DNA sequences from metagenomic libraries.

Bacterial Carbon Processing by Generalist Species in the Coastal Ocean,PRJNA19145,7/2/2008,"Xiaozhen Mou,Mary Ann Moran","Department of Marine Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.",Nature,"Ocean,bacterial carbon,bacteria,Bacterioplankton community",https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06513,,"The assimilation and mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by marine bacterioplankton is a major process in the ocean carbon cycle1. However, little information exists on the specific metabolic functions of participating bacteria and on whether individual taxa specialize on particular components of the marine DOC pool2. Here we use experimental metagenomics to show that coastal communities are populated by taxa capable of metabolizing a wide variety of organic carbon compounds. Genomic DNA captured from bacterial community subsets metabolizing a single model component of the DOC pool (either dimethylsulphoniopropionate or vanillate) showed substantial overlap in gene composition as well as a diversity of carbon-processing capabilities beyond the selected phenotypes. Our direct measure of niche breadth for bacterial functional assemblages indicates that, in accordance with ecological theory, heterogeneity in the composition and supply of organic carbon to coastal oceans may favour generalist bacteria. In the important interplay between microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycling, coastal heterotrophic communities may be controlled less by transient changes in the carbon reservoir that they process and more by factors such as trophic interactions and physical conditions.",,Metagenomic,Aqib Rahim,

In recent years, the role of CO oxidation in superficial ocean waters has been shown to be an important energy supplement for heterotrophs (carboxydovores). The key enzyme CO dehydrogenase was found in both isolates and metagenomes from the ocean's photic zone, where CO is continuously generated by organic matter photolysis. We have also found genes that code for both forms I (low affinity) and II (high affinity) in fosmids from a metagenomic library generated from a 3,000-m depth in the Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of other metagenomic databases indicates that similar genes are also found in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic North Pacific and on the surfaces of this and other oceanic locations (in lower proportions and similarities). The frequency with which this gene was found indicates that this energy-generating metabolism would be at least as important in the bathypelagic habitat as it is in the photic zone. Although there are no data about CO concentrations or origins deep in the ocean, it could have a geothermal origin or be associated with anaerobic metabolism of organic matter. The identities of the microbes that carry out these processes were not established, but they seem to be representatives of either Bacteroidetes or Chloroflexi.",,Metagenomic,Aqib Rahim,

Metagenomic analyses of large genome fragments allow access to both gene content and genome structure from single individuals of these cultivation-reluctant organisms. We present the comparative analysis of 22 archaeal genomic clones containing 16S rRNA genes that were selected from four metagenomic libraries constructed from meso- and bathypelagic plankton of different oceanic regions (South Atlantic, Antarctic Polar Front, Adriatic and Ionian Sea; depths from 500 to 3000 m). We sequenced clones of the divergent archaeal lineages Group 1A (Crenarchaeota) and Group III (Euryarchaeota) as well as clones from the more frequent Group I Crenarchaeota and Group II Euryarchaeota. Whenever possible, we analysed clones that had identical or nearly identical 16S rRNA genes and that were retrieved from distant geographical locations, that is, that defined pan-oceanic operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We detected genes involved in nitrogen fixation in Group 1A Crenarchaeota, and genes involved in carbon fixation pathways and oligopeptide importers in Group I Crenarchaeota, which could confirm the idea that these are mixotrophic. A two-component system resembling that found in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria was found in Group III Euryarchaeota, while genes for anaerobic respiratory chains were detected in Group II Euryarchaeota. Whereas gene sequence conservation was high, and recombination and gene shuffling extensive within and between OTUs in Group I Crenarchaeota, gene sequence conservation was low and global synteny maintained in Group II Euryarchaeota. This implies remarkable differences in genome dynamics in Group I Crenarchaeota and Group II Euryarchaeota with recombination and mutation being, respectively, the dominant genome-shaping forces. These observations, along with variations in GC content, led us to hypothesize that the two groups of organisms have fundamentally different lifestyles.",,Metagenomic,Aqib Rahim,

Isolation of the environmental microbiomes is prerequisite to better understand a myriad of ecosystem services they provide, such as bioremediation of contaminants. Towards this end, in this culturomics study, we evaluated the colonization of soil bacterial and fungal communities within diffusion chambers (DC) and microbial traps (MT) established using uraniferous soils collected from a historically contaminated soil from Aiken, USA. Microbial assemblages were compared between the DC and MT relative to the native soils using amplicon based metagenomic and bioinformatic analysis. The overall rationale of this study is that DC and MT growth chambers provide the optimum conditions under which desired microbiota, identified in a previous study to serve as the “core” microbiomes, will proliferate, leading to their successful isolation. Specifically, the core microbiomes consisted of assemblages of bacteria (Burkholderia spp.) and fungi (Penicillium spp.), respectively. The findings from this study further supported previous data such that the abundance and diversity of the desired “core” microbiomes significantly increased as a function of enrichments over three consecutive generations of DC and MT, respectively. Metagenomic analysis of the DC/MT generations also revealed that enrichment and stable populations of the desired “core” bacterial and fungal microbiomes develop within the first 20 days of incubation and the practice of subsequent transfers for second and third generations, as is standard in previous studies, may be unnecessary. As a cost and time cutting measure, this study recommends running the DC/MT chambers for only a 20-day time period, as opposed to previous studies, which were run for months. In summation, it was concluded that, using the diffusion chamber-based enrichment techniques, growth of desired microbiota possessing environmentally relevant functions can be achieved in a much shorter time frame than has been previously shown.",microorganisms-07-00324 (1).pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3eeb13ab5aa743d97054d047395c7f45/c1e648e6/microorganisms-07-003241.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

However, little is known about the impact of diet-related bacterial shifts in the gut lumen on bacterial translocation into lymph nodes. Here, we (i) characterized changes in the viable microbiota composition along the ileal digesta-mucosa-lymph node axis and (ii) examined the effect of dietary phytase supplementation and lactic acid (LA) soaking of cereals on the bacterial taxonomy along this axis, together with their effect on the mucosal expression of innate immune and barrier function genes in pigs (n = 8/diet). After 18 days on diets, ileal digesta, mucosa, and ileocecal lymph nodes (ICLNs) were collected for RNA isolation and 16S rRNA-based high-resolution community profiling. Bacterial communities were dominated by Lactobacillaceae and Clostridiaceae, with clearly distinguishable profiles at the three sampling sites. Specific bacterial subsampling was indicated by enrichment of the ICLNs with Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Veillonellaceae, and Methanobacteriaceae and less Clostridiaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Helicobacteraceae, and Enterobacteriaceae compared to that of the mucosa. LA treatment of cereals reduced proteolytic taxa in the lumen, including pathobionts like Helicobacteraceae, Campylobacteraceae, and Fusobacteriaceae. When combined, phytase- and LA-treated cereals largely increased species richness, while the single treatments reduced Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in ICLNs and increased mucosal MUC2 expression. In contrast, phytase reduced mucosal CDH1 expression, indicating altered barrier function with potential effects on bacterial translocation. Overall, both treatments, although often differently, changed the viable microbiome along the digesta-mucosa-lymph node axis in the ileum, probably due to altered substrate availability and microbial-host interactions.",PRJNA565518.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c009828c10ed3f45a165fdc39cba1e32/ceaecd82/PRJNA565518.pdf),"Gene Expression,chemistry,illumina,Metagenomic",Maria Meza,

In addition, other studies have detailed how secretions of the labial (salivary) glands can alter host plant defense responses. We examined the gut microbiome of the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni ) feeding on collards (Brassica oleracea ) and separately analyzed the microbiomes of various organs that open directly into the alimentary canal, including the labial glands, mandibular glands, and the Malpighian tubules. In this study, the gut microbiome of T. ni was found to be generally consistent with those of other lepidopteran larvae in prior studies. The greatest diversity of bacteria appeared in the Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. Well‐represented genera included Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , Corynebacterium , Pseudomonas , Diaphorobacter , Methylobacterium , Flavobacterium , and Cloacibacterium . Across all organs, two amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) associated with the genera Diaphorobacter and Cloacibacterium appeared to be most abundant. In terms of the most prevalent ASVs, the alimentary canal, Malpighian tubules, and mandibular glands appeared to have similar complements of bacteria, with relatively few significant differences evident. However, aside from the Diaphorobacter and Cloacibacterium ASVs common to all the organs, the labial glands appeared to possess a distinctive complement of bacteria which was absent or poorly represented in the other organs. Among these were representatives of the Pseudomonas , Flavobacterium , Caulobacterium , Anaerococcus , and Methylobacterium . These results suggest that the labial glands present bacteria with different selective pressures than those occurring in the mandibular gland, Malpighian tubules and the alimentary canal. Given the documented effects that labial gland secretions and the gut microbiome can exert on host plant defenses, the effects exerted by the bacteria inhabiting the labial glands themselves deserve further study.",PRJNA565937.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e9341b139d5a3fac9c8c1666c7d20ca2/b8b815f8/PRJNA565937.pdf),"16S/ITS Amplicon,illumina,Metagenomic",Maria Meza,

In this study, we investigated the overall composition of the gut microbiota and its host specificity and temporal stability in 20 Koreans using 454-pyrosequencing with barcoded primers targeting the V1 to V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. A total of 303,402 high quality reads covered each sample and 8,427 reads were analyzed on average. The results were compared with those of individuals from the USA, China and Japan. In general, microbial communities were dominated by five previously identified phyla: Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria. UPGMA cluster analysis showed that the species composition of gut microbiota was host-specific and stable over the duration of the test period, but the relative abundance of each member fluctuated. 43 core Korean gut microbiota were identified by comparison of sequences from each individual, of which 15 species level phylotypes were related to previously-reported butyrate-producing bacteria. UniFrac analysis revealed that human gut microbiota differed between countries: Korea, USA, Japan and China, but tended to vary less between individual Koreans, suggesting that gut microbial composition is related to internal and external characteristics of each country member such as host genetics and diet styles.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

In this work, the microbial diversity of soil samples from an Atlantic Forest and Caatinga was analyzed using a metagenomic approach. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in both samples. Among which, a significant proportion of stress‐resistant bacteria associated to organic matter degradation was found. Sequences related to metabolism of amino acids, nitrogen, and DNA and stress resistance were more frequent in Caatinga soil, while the forest sample showed the highest occurrence of hits annotated in phosphorous metabolism, defense mechanisms, and aromatic compound degradation subsystems. The principal component analysis (PCA ) showed that our samples are close to the desert metagenomes in relation to taxonomy, but are more similar to rhizosphere microbiota in relation to the functional profiles. The data indicate that soil characteristics affect the taxonomic and functional distribution; these characteristics include low nutrient content, high drainage (both are sandy soils), vegetation, and exposure to stress. In both samples, a rapid turnover of organic matter with low greenhouse gas emission was suggested by the functional profiles obtained, reinforcing the importance of preserving natural areas.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The pervasive nature of metal pollution can be harmful to human health and can potentially cause substantial negative impact to the biosphere. To investigate the impact of anthropogenic metal pollution found in high concentrations in industrial, agricultural, and urban environments, 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to track change in the amplified microbial community after metal contamination in a large-scale field experiment in Shanghai. A total of 1,566 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified from 448,108 sequences gathered from 20 plots treated as controls or with lead, zinc, copper, or all three metals. Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates ordination did not separate control and lead treatment but could separate control/lead, zinc, copper, and three metal treatment. DESeq2 was applied to identify 93 significantly differentially abundant OTUs varying in 211 pairwise instances between the treatments. Differentially abundant OTUs representing genera or species belonging to the phyla Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes were almost universally reduced in abundance due to zinc, copper, or three metal treatment; with three metal treatment abolishing the detection of some OTUs, such as Leptolyngbya, Desmonostoc muscorum, and Microcoleus steenstrupii. The greatest increases due to metal treatment were observed in Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chlamydiae, Nitrospirae, and Proteobacteria (α, β, δ, and γ); the most (relative) abundant being uncharacterized species within the genera Methylobacillus, Solirubrobacter, and Ohtaekwangia. Three metal treatment alone resulted in identification of 22 OTUs (genera or species) which were not detected in control soil, notably including Yonghaparkia alkaliphila, Pedobacter steynii, Pseudolabrys taiwanensis, Methylophilus methylotrophus, Nitrosospira, and Lysobacter mobilis. The capacity to track alterations of an amplified microbial community at high taxonomic resolution using modern bioinformatic approaches, as well as identifying where that resolution is lost for technical or biological reasons, provides an insight into the complexity of the microbial world resisting anthropogenic pollution. While functional assessment of uncharacterized organisms within environmental samples is technically challenging, an important step is observing those organisms able to tolerate extreme stress and to recognize the extent to which important amplifiable community members still require characterization.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Koshiq Hossain,

Rice rhizosphere is a rich niche of microbial diversity influenced by change in atmospheric temperature and concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). Structural changes in microbial communities in rhizosphere influence the nutrient cycling. In the present study, the bacterial diversity and population dynamics were studied under ambient CO2 (a-CO2) and elevated CO2 + temperature (e-CO2T) in lowland rice rhizosphere using whole genome metagenomic approach. The whole genome metagenomic sequence data of lowland rice exhibited the dominance of bacterial communities including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes. Interestingly, four genera related to methane production namely, Methanobacterium, Methanosphaera, Methanothermus and Methanothermococcus were absent in a-CO2 but noticed under e-CO2T. The acetoclastic pathway was found as the predominant pathway for methanogenesis, whereas, the serine pathway was found as the principal metabolic pathway for CH4 oxidation in lowland rice. The abundances of reads of enzymes in the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway and serine pathways of methanotrophy were much higher in e-CO2T (328 and 182, respectively) as compared with a-CO2 (118 and 98, respectively). Rice rhizosphere showed higher structural diversities and functional activities in relation to N metabolism involving nitrogen fixation, assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification under e-CO2T than that of a-CO2. Among the three pathways of N metabolism, dissimilarity pathways were predominant in lowland rice rhizosphere and more so under e-CO2T. Consequently, under e-CO2T, CH4 emission, microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) and dehydrogenase activities were 45%, 20% and 35% higher than a-CO2, respectively. Holistically, a high bacterial diversity and abundances of C and N decomposing bacteria in lowland rice rhizosphere were found under e-CO2T, which could be explored further for their specific role in nutrient cycling, sustainable agriculture and environment management.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The microbial communities and metabolic potential in these ecosystems are largely uncharacterized. Here, we present four single amplified genomes (SAGs) obtained from 8,219 m below the sea surface within the hadal ecosystem of the Puerto Rico Trench (PRT). These SAGs are derived from members of deep-sea clades, including the Thaumarchaeota and SAR11 clade, and two are related to previously isolated piezophilic (high-pressure-adapted) microorganisms. In order to identify genes that might play a role in adaptation to deep-sea environments, comparative analyses were performed with genomes from closely related shallow-water microbes. The archaeal SAG possesses genes associated with mixotrophy, including lipoylation and the glycine cleavage pathway. The SAR11 SAG encodes glycolytic enzymes previously reported to be missing from this abundant and cosmopolitan group. The other SAGs, which are related to piezophilic isolates, possess genes that may supplement energy demands through the oxidation of hydrogen or the reduction of nitrous oxide. We found evidence for potential trench-specific gene distributions, as several SAG genes were observed only in a PRT metagenome and not in shallower deep-sea metagenomes. These results illustrate new ecotype features that might perform important roles in the adaptation of microorganisms to life in hadal environments.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The SS-inoculated MFC outperformed the IGBS-inoculated MFC with regard to COD and VFA removal and electricity production. Using a metagenomic approach, we describe the microbial diversity of the MFC planktonic and anodic communities derived from the different inocula. Proteobacteria (mostly Deltaproteobacteria) became the predominant phylum in both MFC anodic communities with amplification of the electrogenic genus Geobacter being the most pronounced. Eight dominant and three minor species of Geobacter were found in both MFC anodic communities. The anodic communities of the SS-inoculated MFCs had a higher proportion of Clostridium and Bacteroides relative to those of the IGBS-inoculated MFCs, which were enriched with Pelobacter.

Microbes colonize the neonatal gut immediately following birth. The establishment and interactive development of this early gut microbiota are believed to be (at least partially) driven and modulated by specific compounds present in human milk. It has been shown that certain genomes of infant gut commensals, in particular those of bifidobacterial species, are genetically adapted to utilize specific glycans of this human secretory fluid, thus representing a very intriguing example of host-microbe coevolution, where both partners are believed to benefit. In recent years, various metagenomic studies have tried to dissect the composition and functionality of the infant gut microbiome and to explore the distribution across the different ecological niches of the infant gut biogeography of the corresponding microbial consortia, including those corresponding to bacteria and viruses, in healthy and ill subjects. Such analyses have linked certain features of the microbiota/microbiome, such as reduced diversity or aberrant composition, to intestinal illnesses in infants or disease states that are manifested at later stages of life, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders. Thus, a growing number of studies have reported on how the early human gut microbiota composition/development may affect risk factors related to adult health conditions. This concept has fueled the development of strategies to shape the infant microbiota composition based on various functional food products. In this review, we describe the infant microbiota, the mechanisms that drive its establishment and composition, and how microbial consortia may be molded by natural or artificial interventions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of key microbial players of the infant gut microbiota, in particular bifidobacteria, with respect to their role in health and disease.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Here, we have analyzed 26 sequences of myophages that putatively infect the SAR11 clade. They have been retrieved by mining ca. 45 Gbp aquatic assembled cellular metagenomes and viromes. Most of the myophages were obtained from the cellular fraction (0.2 μm), indicating a bias against this type of virus in viromes. We have found the first myophages that putatively infect Candidatus Fonsibacter (freshwater SAR11) and another group putatively infecting bathypelagic SAR11 phylogroup Ic. The genomes have similar sizes and maintain overall synteny in spite of low average nucleotide identity values, revealing high similarity to marine cyanomyophages. Pelagimyophages recruited metagenomic reads widely from several locations but always much more from cellular metagenomes than from viromes, opposite to what happens with pelagipodophages. Comparing the genomes resulted in the identification of a hypervariable island that is related to host recognition. Interestingly, some genes in these islands could be related to host cell wall synthesis and coinfection avoidance. A cluster of curli-related proteins was widespread among the genomes, although its function is unclear.

IMPORTANCE SAR11 clade members are among the most abundant bacteria on Earth. Their study is complicated by their great diversity and difficulties in being grown and manipulated in the laboratory. On the other hand, and due to their extraordinary abundance, metagenomic data sets provide enormous richness of information about these microbes. Given the major role played by phages in the lifestyle and evolution of prokaryotic cells, the contribution of several new bacteriophage genomes preying on this clade opens windows into the infection strategies and life cycle of its viruses. Such strategies could provide models of attack of large-genome phages preying on streamlined aquatic microbes.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Microbial Diversity in the Midguts of Field and Lab-Reared Populations of the European Corn Borer Ostrinia nubilalis,PRJNA65039,30/6/2011,"Eugeni Belda,Manuel Porcar","Eugeni Belda,Laia Pedrola,Juli Peretó,Juan F.

Insects are associated with microorganisms that contribute to the digestion and processing of nutrients. The European Corn Borer (ECB) is a moth present world-wide, causing severe economical damage as a pest on corn and other crops. In the present work, we give a detailed view of the complexity of the microorganisms forming the ECB midgut microbiota with the objective of comparing the biodiversity of the midgut-associated microbiota and explore their potential as a source of genes and enzymes with biotechnological applications.

Methodological/Principal Findings
A high-throughput sequencing approach has been used to identify bacterial species, genes and metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in plant-matter degradation, in two different ECB populations (field-collected vs. lab-reared population with artificial diet). Analysis of the resulting sequences revealed the massive presence of Staphylococcus warneri and Weissella paramesenteroides in the lab-reared sample. This enabled us to reconstruct both genomes almost completely. Despite the apparently low diversity, 208 different genera were detected in the sample, although most of them at very low frequency. By contrast, the natural population exhibited an even higher taxonomic diversity along with a wider array of cellulolytic enzyme families. However, in spite of the differences in relative abundance of major taxonomic groups, not only did both metagenomes share a similar functional profile but also a similar distribution of non-redundant genes in different functional categories.

Conclusions/Significance
Our results reveal a highly diverse pool of bacterial species in both O. nubilalis populations, with major differences: The lab-reared sample is rich in gram-positive species (two of which have almost fully sequenced genomes) while the field sample harbors mainly gram-negative species and has a larger set of cellulolytic enzymes. We have found a clear relationship between the diet and the midgut microbiota, which reveals the selection pressure of food on the community of intestinal bacteria.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Infection from individual strains has conventionally been thought to be species-specific. Here we applied the Virochip, a pan-viral microarray, to identify a novel adenovirus (TMAdV, titi monkey adenovirus) as the cause of a deadly outbreak in a closed colony of New World monkeys (titi monkeys; Callicebus cupreus) at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). Among 65 titi monkeys housed in a building, 23 (34%) developed upper respiratory symptoms that progressed to fulminant pneumonia and hepatitis, and 19 of 23 monkeys, or 83% of those infected, died or were humanely euthanized. Whole-genome sequencing of TMAdV revealed that this adenovirus is a new species and highly divergent, sharing <57% pairwise nucleotide identity with other adenoviruses. Cultivation of TMAdV was successful in a human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line, but not in primary or established monkey kidney cells. At the onset of the outbreak, the researcher in closest contact with the monkeys developed an acute respiratory illness, with symptoms persisting for 4 weeks, and had a convalescent serum sample seropositive for TMAdV. A clinically ill family member, despite having no contact with the CNPRC, also tested positive, and screening of a set of 81 random adult blood donors from the Western United States detected TMAdV-specific neutralizing antibodies in 2 individuals (2/81, or 2.5%). These findings raise the possibility of zoonotic infection by TMAdV and human-to-human transmission of the virus in the population. Given the unusually high case fatality rate from the outbreak (83%), it is unlikely that titi monkeys are the native host species for TMAdV, and the natural reservoir of the virus is still unknown. The discovery of TMAdV, a novel adenovirus with the capacity to infect both monkeys and humans, suggests that adenoviruses should be monitored closely as potential causes of cross-species outbreaks.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

This clinical review provides an update encompassing the virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Because information about this virus, its prevention, and treatment are rapidly evolving, readers are advised to seek additional information.

On April 21, 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 2 cases (originally identified by the Department of Defense) of a febrile respiratory illness in children from southern California caused by infection with a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.1 The 2 viral isolates were found to be genetically similar, to be resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, and to contain a novel genetic combination of segments from previous swine influenza viruses that have circulated in the United States since 1999, genes from swine viruses of the Eurasian lineage, and genes from avian influenza viruses. Neither of these children had exposure to swine or to each other, indicating that this virus was capable of human-to-human transmission. Several days later, the CDC reported that H1N1 viruses of the same strain had been confirmed among samples from patients in Mexico, where there was a cluster of 47 cases of rapidly progressive severe pneumonia that resulted in 12 known deaths.2,3

In response to these cases, investigations and enhanced surveillance were implemented by the Mexican Ministry of Health with the assistance of the World Health Organization (WHO). By June 11, 2009, nearly 30,000 cases of 2009 H1N1 virus had been confirmed across 74 countries, compelling the WHO to signal the phase 6 alert level, officially declaring the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic (Table 1).4

Hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling partition the samples into four broad groups, regardless of geographic location: a photic-zone community, a subphotic community, a shallow sedimentary community and a subseafloor sedimentary community (⩾1.5 meters below seafloor). Abundance-weighted community compositions of water-column samples exhibit a similar trend with depth at all sites, with successive epipelagic, mesopelagic, bathypelagic and abyssopelagic communities. Taxonomic richness is generally highest in the water-column O2 minimum zone and lowest in the subseafloor sediment. OTUs represented by abundant tags in the subseafloor sediment are often present but represented by few tags in the water column, and represented by moderately abundant tags in the shallow sediment. In contrast, OTUs represented by abundant tags in the water are generally absent from the subseafloor sediment.

A mitigation strategy is the oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide, which is approximately twenty-one times less effective at global warming than methane on a mass-basis. The low non-combustible methane concentrations at high MVA flow rates call for a catalytic strategy of oxidation. A laboratory-scale coal-packed biofilter was designed and partially removed methane from humidified air at flow rates between 0.2 and 2.4 L min−1 at 30°C with nutrient solution added every three days. Methane oxidation was catalysed by a complex community of naturally-occurring microorganisms, with the most abundant member being identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence as belonging to the methanotrophic genus Methylocystis. Additional inoculation with a laboratory-grown culture of Methylosinus sporium, as investigated in a parallel run, only enhanced methane consumption during the initial 12 weeks. The greatest level of methane removal of 27.2±0.66 g methane m−3 empty bed h−1 was attained for the non-inoculated system, which was equivalent to removing 19.7±2.9% methane from an inlet concentration of 1% v/v at an inlet gas flow rate of 1.6 L min−1 (2.4 min empty bed residence time).

Yet the symbiotic roles of gut microbes residing in its major feeding caste remain largely undefined. Here, by pyrosequencing the whole gut metagenome of adult workers of a fungus-cultivating termite (Odontotermes yunnanensis), we showed that it did harbor a broad set of genes or gene modules encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) relevant to plant fiber degradation, particularly debranching enzymes and oligosaccharide-processing enzymes. Besides, it also contained a considerable number of genes encoding chitinases and glycoprotein oligosaccharide-processing enzymes for fungal cell wall degradation. To investigate the metabolic divergence of higher termites of different feeding guilds, a SEED subsystem-based gene-centric comparative analysis of the data with that of a previously sequenced wood-feeding Nasutitermes hindgut microbiome was also attempted, revealing that SEED classifications of nitrogen metabolism, and motility and chemotaxis were significantly overrepresented in the wood-feeder hindgut metagenome, while Bacteroidales conjugative transposons and subsystems related to central aromatic compounds metabolism were apparently overrepresented here.

Plant, insect, and algal viruses as well as bacteriophages were also present. These viruses represented 26 taxonomic families and included viruses with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), positive-sense ssRNA [ssRNA(+)], and dsRNA genomes. Novel viruses that could be placed in specific taxa represented 51 different families, making untreated wastewater the most diverse viral metagenome (genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples) examined thus far. However, the vast majority of sequence reads bore little or no sequence relation to known viruses and thus could not be placed into specific taxa.

Untreated wastewater provides a rich matrix for identifying novel viruses and for studying virus diversity.

IMPORTANCE At this time, virology is focused on the study of a relatively small number of viral species. Specific viruses are studied either because they are easily propagated in the laboratory or because they are associated with disease. The lack of knowledge of the size and characteristics of the viral universe and the diversity of viral genomes is a roadblock to understanding important issues, such as the origin of emerging pathogens and the extent of gene exchange among viruses. Untreated wastewater is an ideal system for assessing viral diversity because virion populations from large numbers of individuals are deposited and because raw sewage itself provides a rich environment for the growth of diverse host species and thus their viruses.

Cyanobacteria were responsible for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, and have since come to colonize almost every environment on Earth. Here we show that their ecological range is not limited by the presence of sunlight, but also extends down to the deep terrestrial biosphere. We report the presence of microbial communities dominated by cyanobacteria in the continental subsurface using microscopy, metagenomics, and antibody microarrays. These cyanobacteria were related to surface rock-dwelling lineages known for their high tolerance to environmental and nutritional stress. We discuss how these adaptations allow cyanobacteria to thrive in the dark underground, a lifestyle that might trace back to their nonphotosynthetic ancestors.

Abstract
Cyanobacteria are ecologically versatile microorganisms inhabiting most environments, ranging from marine systems to arid deserts. Although they possess several pathways for light-independent energy generation, until now their ecological range appeared to be restricted to environments with at least occasional exposure to sunlight. Here we present molecular, microscopic, and metagenomic evidence that cyanobacteria predominate in deep subsurface rock samples from the Iberian Pyrite Belt Mars analog (southwestern Spain). Metagenomics showed the potential for a hydrogen-based lithoautotrophic cyanobacterial metabolism. Collectively, our results suggest that they may play an important role as primary producers within the deep-Earth biosphere. Our description of this previously unknown ecological niche for cyanobacteria paves the way for models on their origin and evolution, as well as on their potential presence in current or primitive biospheres in other planetary bodies, and on the extant, primitive, and putative extraterrestrial biospheres.

The deep terrestrial biosphere is receiving increasing interest as it harbors a significant fraction of the total microbial biomass of the planet (1⇓–3), yet also imposes severe energy and nutrient limitations on its inhabitants (4). Subsurface life is dependent on buried organic matter and lithogenically sourced compounds such as molecular hydrogen (5). Despite its inhospitality, the deep subsurface is a stable and sheltered environment, which makes it a good candidate habitat for the development of early life on Earth, as well as on potential extraterrestrial scenarios (6). Despite the increasing interest in deep subsurface ecosystems, obtaining reliable data on their microbiology is severely hampered by the high cost and technical difficulty of retrieving pristine samples, its heterogeneity and extent, and the vanishingly small microbial loads (7). The majority of deep subsurface habitats thus remain significantly underexplored (6).

The Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) in southwestern Spain hosts one of the largest sulphide deposits in the world, as well as the Río Tinto Mars analog (8⇓–10). In previous work, we characterized pyrite-rich drill core samples down to 166-m depth with several molecular ecology techniques, and revealed a subsurface ecosystem with active iron and sulfur cycles (9). To investigate the microbiota and their activities in a deeper, more pristine location, we carried out a second drilling at a site ∼500 m from the previous one, where geophysical studies and tritium measurements showed the presence of an aquifer formed by ∼60-y-old groundwater at a depth of around 400 m (10). A 613-m-deep borehole was drilled, implementing procedures for aseptic sampling and for tracing potential contamination events during drilling and subsequent processing of the retrieved rock cores. These procedures minimized contamination of samples with extraneous microbes, enabled us to identify any samples that had been contaminated, and if so, to quantify any such contamination.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

DNA was isolated from the vagina (introitus, posterior fornix, midvagina) and the V5V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced (454FLX Titanium platform). Sixty-eight samples from 24 healthy gravidae (18 to 40 confirmed weeks) were compared with 301 non-pregnant controls (60 subjects). Generated sequence data were quality filtered, taxonomically binned, normalized, and organized by phylogeny and into operational taxonomic units (OTU); principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the resultant beta diversity measures were used for visualization and analysis in association with sample clinical metadata. Altogether, 1.4 gigabytes of data containing >2.5 million reads (averaging 6,837 sequences/sample of 493 nt in length) were generated for computational analyses. Although gravidae were not excluded by virtue of a posterior fornix pH >4.5 at the time of screening, unique vaginal microbiome signature encompassing several specific OTUs and higher-level clades was nevertheless observed and confirmed using a combination of phylogenetic, non-phylogenetic, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. Both overall diversity and richness were reduced in pregnancy, with dominance of Lactobacillus species (L. iners crispatus, jensenii and johnsonii, and the orders Lactobacillales (and Lactobacillaceae family), Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Actinomycetales. This intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analytical methodologies provides robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial 16S rRNA gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of taxa across vaginal subsite and gestational age.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of chickens harbor a diverse and complex microbiota that plays a vital role in digestion and absorption of nutrients, immune system development and pathogen exclusion. However, the integrity, functionality, and health of the chicken gut depends on many factors including the environment, feed, and the GI microbiota. The symbiotic interactions between host and microbe is fundamental to poultry health and production. The diversity of the chicken GI microbiota is largely influenced by the age of the birds, location in the digestive tract and diet. Until recently, research on the poultry GI microbiota relied on conventional microbiological techniques that can only culture a small proportion of the complex community comprising the GI microbiota. 16S rRNA based next generation sequencing is a powerful tool to investigate the biological and ecological roles of the GI microbiota in chicken. Although several challenges remain in understanding the chicken GI microbiome, optimizing the taxonomic composition and biochemical functions of the GI microbiome is an attainable goal in the post-genomic era. This article reviews the current knowledge on the chicken GI function and factors that influence the diversity of gut microbiota.

Metagenomic analysis of microbial community and function involved in cd-contaminated soil,PRJDA73169,13/2/2018,"Gang Feng,Yun Zhao","Gang Feng, Tian Xie, Xin Wang, Jiuyuan Bai, Lin Tang, Hai Zhao, Wei Wei, Maolin Wang & Yun Zhao ",BMC Microbiology,"Metagenome,microbiota,microbial",https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-018-1152-5,,"Background
Soil contaminated with the heavy metal Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread problem in many parts of the world. Based on metagenomic analysis, we investigated the functional potential and structural diversity of the microbial community in Cd-contaminated and non-contaminated soil samples and we explored the associated metabolic pathway network in cluster of orthologous groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

Results
The results showed that microorganisms in these soils were quite abundant, and many of them possessed numerous physiological functions. However, Cd-contamination has the potential to reduce the microbial diversity and further alter the community structure in the soil. Notably, function analysis of the crucial microorganisms (e. g. Proteobacteria, Sulfuricella and Thiobacillus) indicated that these bacteria and their corresponding physiological functions were important for the community to cope with Cd pollution. The COG annotation demonstrated that the predominant category was the microbial metabolism cluster in both soil samples, while the relative abundance of metabolic genes was increased in the Cd-contaminated soil. The KEGG annotation results exhibited that the non-contaminated soil had more genes, pathways, modules, orthologies and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways of microbial communities than the Cd-contaminated soil. The relative abundance of some dominant KEGG pathways increased in the Cd contaminated soil, and they were mostly enriched to the metabolism, biosynthesis and degradation of amino acids, fatty acids and nucleotides, which was related to Cd tolerance of the microorganisms.

Conclusions
Cd-contamination can decrease the taxonomic species of microbes in soil and change the soil microbial composition. The functional pathways involved in the soil change with microbial structure variation, many of which are related to the heavy metal tolerance of soil microbes. The Cd-contaminated soil microbes is a potential resource for exploring cadmium resistant or tolerant bacteria.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

In this study, metagenomic approaches were used to monitor changes in bacterial populations, metabolic potential, and overall genetic features of the microbial community during the 29-day fermentation process. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from kimchi samples obtained periodically and was sequenced using a 454 GS FLX Titanium system, which yielded a total of 701,556 reads, with an average read length of 438 bp. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA genes from the metagenome indicated that the kimchi microbiome was dominated by members of three genera: Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Weissella. Assignment of metagenomic sequences to SEED categories of the Metagenome Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST) server revealed a genetic profile characteristic of heterotrophic lactic acid fermentation of carbohydrates, which was supported by the detection of mannitol, lactate, acetate, and ethanol as fermentation products. When the metagenomic reads were mapped onto the database of completed genomes, the Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ATCC 8293 and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 23K genomes were highly represented. These same two genera were confirmed to be important in kimchi fermentation when the majority of kimchi metagenomic sequences showed very high identity to Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus genes. Besides microbial genome sequences, a surprisingly large number of phage DNA sequences were identified from the cellular fractions, possibly indicating that a high proportion of cells were infected by bacteriophages during fermentation. Overall, these results provide insights into the kimchi microbial community and also shed light on fermentation processes carried out broadly by complex microbial communities.

Kimchi is a traditional food, emblematic of Korean culture, that is fermented from vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and radish. In recent years, kimchi's health-promoting characteristics have been recognized (40, 54). Kimchi is usually processed with various seasonings, such as red pepper powder, garlic, ginger, green onion, fermented seafood (jeotgal), and salts, at low temperatures to ensure proper ripening and preservation. Spontaneous fermentation without the use of starter cultures or sterilization leads to the growth of various microorganisms during kimchi preparation. Moreover, the influence of ingredients and fermentation conditions on the microbial community is unexplored, and a rational approach to the control of the microbial community for the improvement of kimchi flavor is currently almost impossible.

Microbes involved in kimchi fermentation have been studied previously (25, 26). Taxonomic studies of bacteria isolated and purified from kimchi fermenting cultures have shown that lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including the Leuconostoc species Le. mesenteroides, Le. kimchii, Le. citreum, Le. gasicomitatum, and Le. gelidum, the Lactobacillus species Lb. brevis, Lb. curvatus, Lb. plantarum, and Lb. sakei, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella confusa, Weissella kimchii, and Weissella koreensis, are likely to be key players responsible for kimchi fermentation (2, 21, 23, 27, 42, 51). However, culture-based approaches have known limitations in terms of reproducibility and challenges in the culturability of some bacteria. Therefore, the set of cultured isolates may not reflect the true microbial composition of fermented kimchi.

The use of 16S rRNA genes as a phylogenetic marker that does not require isolation and cultivation of microorganisms has resulted in a tremendous amount of information about naturally occurring microbial communities in various habitats (8, 48). When applied to kimchi, the construction of 16S rRNA clone libraries has extended information about kimchi microbiology (42). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, and the subsequent sequencing of 16S rRNA genes were additional techniques used to elucidate the microbial community involved in kimchi fermentation (23, 27). Although these culture-independent approaches can estimate species richness within a kimchi microbial community, they are unable to resolve the true genotypic diversity, because diversity of 16S rRNA gene sequences may not correlate well with genotypic and phenotypic diversity (60). Thus, although progress made using 16S RNA gene analysis and culture-based methods has been significant, current understanding of kimchi microbiology is piecemeal and has significant limitations regarding community dynamics and function during fermentation (12, 28, 38).

Metagenomic approaches based on the random sequencing of environmental DNA can provide a wealth of information (free of PCR bias) about gene content, metabolic potential, and the function of microbial communities (9). Recently, the development of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies (50), such as 454 pyrosequencing, has led to the large-scale metagenomic sequencing of environmental habitats, such as activated sludge (15, 49), the coastal ocean (36), glacier ice (52), and the human distal gut (45).

It is well known that kimchi fermentation is generally characterized by the production of metabolites, such as organic acids (lactic and acetic acids) and other flavoring compounds, which are important components in defining kimchi quality (19). The presence of various metabolites can reflect the presence of related genes in the microbial population and give a more direct collective phenotypic view of the kimchi microbiome as a consequence of the end products of gene expression. The fermentation rate is also very important to kimchi flavor development during fermentation (24). 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) is one of the most comprehensive, easy, and nondestructive multinuclear techniques to simultaneously monitor several substances present in one sample (14, 29).

Here, we applied metagenomic approaches using pyrosequencing technology developed by 454 Life Sciences to kimchi. In addition, we conducted a metabolite analysis of fermenting kimchi using 1H-NMR to collectively understand the overall features of the kimchi microbiome and to investigate relationships between metabolite production, metabolic potential, and composition of the kimchi microbial community during fermentation.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Although the phylogenetic diversity of these microorganisms has been described previously, the adaptation and metabolic potential of the microbial communities is only beginning to be revealed. A pyrosequencing approach was used to directly obtain sequences from a fosmid library constructed from a black smoker chimney 4143-1 in the Mothra hydrothermal vent field at the Juan de Fuca Ridge. A total of 308 034 reads with an average sequence length of 227 bp were generated. Comparative genomic analyses of metagenomes from a variety of environments by two-way clustering of samples and functional gene categories demonstrated that the 4143-1 metagenome clustered most closely with that from a carbonate chimney from Lost City. Both are highly enriched in genes for mismatch repair and homologous recombination, suggesting that the microbial communities have evolved extensive DNA repair systems to cope with the extreme conditions that have potential deleterious effects on the genomes. As previously reported for the Lost City microbiome, the metagenome of chimney 4143-1 exhibited a high proportion of transposases, implying that horizontal gene transfer may be a common occurrence in the deep-sea vent chimney biosphere. In addition, genes for chemotaxis and flagellar assembly were highly enriched in the chimney metagenomes, reflecting the adaptation of the organisms to the highly dynamic conditions present within the chimney walls. Reconstruction of the metabolic pathways revealed that the microbial community in the wall of chimney 4143-1 was mainly fueled by sulfur oxidation, putatively coupled to nitrate reduction to perform inorganic carbon fixation through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle. On the basis of the genomic organization of the key genes of the carbon fixation and sulfur oxidation pathways contained in the large genomic fragments, both obligate and facultative autotrophs appear to be present and contribute to biomass production.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The sediments vary in age, organic carbon content, porewater salinity, and other parameters that reflect the changing Baltic environment from the last ice age and throughout the Holocene. We found microorganisms capable of energy conservation by fermentation, acetogenesis, methanogenesis, anaerobic oxidation of methane, and reductive dehalogenation. Glacial sediments showed a greater relative abundance of genes encoding enzymes in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase than Holocene sediments. Relative abundance of genes conferring salinity tolerance was found to correlate with the present salinity, even in deep late-glacial sediment layers where salinity has increased since the sediment was deposited in a freshwater lake > 9000 years ago.

Virus abundance ranged from 10(6) to 10(11) viruses/cm(3) of sediments (down to 30 cm below the seafloor [cmbsf]).

Among the sequences identified as potential viral genes based on the BLAST search, 95-99% of the sequence reads in each library were related to genes from single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viral families, including Microviridae, Circoviridae, and Geminiviridae. A relatively high abundance of sequences related to the genetic markers (major capsid protein [VP1] and replication protein [Rep]) of two ssDNA viral groups were also detected in these libraries, thereby revealing a high genotypic diversity of their viruses (833 genotypes for VP1 and 2,551 genotypes for Rep). A majority of the viral genes predicted from each library were classified into three ssDNA viral protein categories: Rep, VP1, and minor capsid protein.

Prokaryotic microbes, the most abundant organisms in the ocean, are remarkably diverse. Despite numerous studies of marine prokaryotes, the zonation of their communities in pelagic zones has been poorly delineated. By exploiting the persistent stratification of the South China Sea (SCS), we performed a 2-year, large spatial scale (10, 100, 1000, and 3000 m) survey, which included a pilot study in 2006 and comprehensive sampling in 2007, to investigate the biological zonation of bacteria and archaea using 16S rRNA tag and shotgun metagenome sequencing.

Results
Alphaproteobacteria dominated the bacterial community in the surface SCS, where the abundance of Betaproteobacteria was seemingly associated with climatic activity. Gammaproteobacteria thrived in the deep SCS, where a noticeable amount of Cyanobacteria were also detected. Marine Groups II and III Euryarchaeota were predominant in the archaeal communities in the surface and deep SCS, respectively. Bacterial diversity was higher than archaeal diversity at all sampling depths in the SCS, and peaked at mid-depths, agreeing with the diversity pattern found in global water columns. Metagenomic analysis not only showed differential %GC values and genome sizes between the surface and deep SCS, but also demonstrated depth-dependent metabolic potentials, such as cobalamin biosynthesis at 10 m, osmoregulation at 100 m, signal transduction at 1000 m, and plasmid and phage replication at 3000 m. When compared with other oceans, urease at 10 m and both exonuclease and permease at 3000 m were more abundant in the SCS. Finally, enriched genes associated with nutrient assimilation in the sea surface and transposase in the deep-sea metagenomes exemplified the functional zonation in global oceans.

Conclusions
Prokaryotic communities in the SCS stratified with depth, with maximal bacterial diversity at mid-depth, in accordance with global water columns. The SCS had functional zonation among depths and endemically enriched metabolic potentials at the study site, in contrast to other oceans.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The role of microbial processes in methane cycling and organic transformation in such environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to uncover functional potentials and community assemblages across geochemical transitions in a ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MV of eastern Taiwan. Geochemical profiles combined with 16S rRNA gene abundances indicated that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by ANME-2a group coincided with iron/manganese reduction by Desulfuromonadales at shallow depths deprived of sulfate. The activity of AOM was stimulated either by methane alone or by methane and a range of electron acceptors, such as sulfate, ferrihydrite, and artificial humic acid. Metagenomic analyses revealed that functional genes for AOM and metal reduction were more abundant at shallow intervals. In particular, genes encoding pili expression and electron transport through multi-heme cytochromes were prevalent, suggesting potential intercellular interactions for electron transport involved in AOM. For comparison, genes responsible for methanogenesis and degradation of chitin and plant-derived molecules were more abundant at depth. The gene distribution combined with the enhanced proportions of 16S rRNA genes related to methanogens and heterotrophs, and geochemical characteristics suggest that particulate organic matter was degraded into various organic entities that could further fuel in situ methanogenesis. Finally, genes responsible for aerobic methane oxidation were more abundant in the bubbling pool and near-surface sediments. These methane oxidizers account for the ultimate attenuation of methane discharge into the atmosphere. Overall, our results demonstrated that various community members were compartmentalized into stratified niches along geochemical gradients. These community members form a metabolic network that cascades the carbon transformation from the upstream degradation of recalcitrant organic carbon with fermentative production of labile organic entities and methane to downstream methane oxidation and metal reduction near the surface. Such a metabolic architecture enables effective methane removal under ferruginous, sulfate-depleted conditions in terrestrial MVs.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The complete genome of HPV-SD2 is 7,299 bp long (36.3% G/C) and contains 7 open reading frames (L2, L1, E6, E7, E1, E2 and E4) and a non-coding long control region (LCR) between L1 and E6. The metagenomic procedures, coupled with the bioinformatic methods described herein are well suited to detect small circular genomes such as those of human papillomaviruses.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

However, the relationship between probiotic dose, time since probiotic consumption, changes in the microbiota, and immune system requires further investigation. The objective of this study was to determine if the effect of Lactobacillus casei 32G on the murine gastrointestinal microbiota and immune function are dose and time dependent. Mice were fed L. casei 32G at doses of 106, 107, or 108 CFU/day/mouse for seven days and were sacrificed 0.5h, 3.5h, 12h, or 24h after the last administration. The ileum tissue and the cecal content were collected for immune profiling by qPCR and microbiota analysis, respectively. The time required for L. casei 32G to reach the cecum was monitored by qPCR and the 32G bolus reaches the cecum 3.5h after the last administration. L. casei 32G altered the cecal microbiota with the predominance of Lachnospiraceae IS, and Oscillospira decreasing significantly (p < 0.05) in the mice receiving 108 CFU/mouse 32G relative to the control mice, while a significant (p < 0.05) increase was observed in the prevalence of lactobacilli. The lactobacilli that increased were determined to be a commensal lactobacilli. Interestingly, no significant difference in the overall microbiota composition, regardless of 32G doses, was observed at the 12h time point. A likely explanation for this observation is the level of feed derived-nutrients resulting from the 12h light/dark cycle. 32G results in consistent increases in Clec2h expression and reductions in TLR-2, alpha-defensins, and lysozyme. Changes in expression of these components of the innate immune system are one possible explanation for the observed changes in the cecal microbiota. Additionally, 32G administration was observed to alter the expression of cytokines (IL-10rb and TNF-α) in a manner consistent with an anti-inflammatory response.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,
Comparative genomics of two ‘Candidatus Accumulibacter' clades performing biological phosphorus removal,PRJNA81811,25/7/2013,"Jason J Flowers,Katherine D McMahon","Jason J Flowers,1 Shaomei He,2 Stephanie Malfatti,2 Tijana Glavina del Rio,2 Susannah G Tringe,2 Philip Hugenholtz,3 and Katherine D McMahon1,*",ISME,"Water Microbiology,water pollution,Search Algorithm",10.1038/ismej.2013.117,,"Members of the genus Candidatus Accumulibacter are important in many wastewater treatment systems performing enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). The Accumulibacter lineage can be subdivided phylogenetically into multiple clades, and previous work showed that these clades are ecologically distinct. The complete genome of Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis strain UW-1, a member of Clade IIA, was previously sequenced. Here, we report a draft genome sequence of Candidatus Accumulibacter spp. strain UW-2, a member of Clade IA, assembled following shotgun metagenomic sequencing of laboratory-scale bioreactor sludge. We estimate the genome to be 80–90% complete. Although the two clades share 16S rRNA sequence identity of >98.0%, we observed a remarkable lack of synteny between the two genomes. We identified 2317 genes shared between the two genomes, with an average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 78.3%, and accounting for 49% of genes in the UW-1 genome. Unlike UW-1, the UW-2 genome seemed to lack genes for nitrogen fixation and carbon fixation. Despite these differences, metabolic genes essential for denitrification and EBPR, including carbon storage polymer and polyphosphate metabolism, were conserved in both genomes. The ANI from genes associated with EBPR was statistically higher than that from genes not associated with EBPR, indicating a high selective pressure in EBPR systems. Further, we identified genomic islands of foreign origins including a near-complete lysogenic phage in the Clade IA genome. Interestingly, Clade IA appeared to be more phage susceptible based on it containing only a single Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats locus as compared with the two found in Clade IIA. Overall, the comparative analysis provided a genetic basis to understand physiological differences and ecological niches of Accumulibacter populations, and highlights the importance of diversity in maintaining system functional resilience.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,
Reconstructing viral genomes from the environment using fosmid clones: the case of haloviruses,PRJNA82917,30/3/2012,"Inmaculada Garcia-Heredia,Francisco Rodríguez-Valera","Inmaculada Garcia-Heredia,Ana-Belen Martin-Cuadrado,Francisco J. M. Mojica,Fernando Santos,Alex Mira,Josefa Antón,Francisco Rodriguez-Valera ",Plos One,"Genome,microbiota,microbial",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033802,,"Background
Metaviriomes, the viral genomes present in an environment, have been studied by direct sequencing of the viral DNA or by cloning in small insert libraries. The short reads generated by both approaches make it very difficult to assemble and annotate such flexible genomic entities. Many environmental viruses belong to unknown groups or prey on uncultured and little known cellular lineages, and hence might not be present in databases.

Methodology and Principal Findings
Here we have used a different approach, the cloning of viral DNA into fosmids before sequencing, to obtain natural contigs that are close to the size of a viral genome. We have studied a relatively low diversity extreme environment: saturated NaCl brines, which simplifies the analysis and interpretation of the data. Forty-two different viral genomes were retrieved, and some of these were almost complete, and could be tentatively identified as head-tail phages (Caudovirales).

Conclusions and Significance
We found a cluster of phage genomes that most likely infect Haloquadratum walsbyi, the square archaeon and major component of the community in these hypersaline habitats. The identity of the prey could be confirmed by the presence of CRISPR spacer sequences shared by the virus and one of the available strain genomes. Other viral clusters detected appeared to prey on the Nanohaloarchaea and on the bacterium Salinibacter ruber, covering most of the diversity of microbes found in this type of environment. This approach appears then as a viable alternative to describe metaviriomes in a much more detailed and reliable way than by the more common approaches based on direct sequencing. An example of transfer of a CRISPR cluster including repeats and spacers was accidentally found supporting the dynamic nature and frequent transfer of this peculiar prokaryotic mechanism of cell protection.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Red maple (Acer rubrum) and water oak (Quercus nigra) leaf litter were incubated in situ for 128 days, and litter breakdown was quantified by ash-free dry mass (AFDM) method and microbial assemblage composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and bar-coded next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Leaf breakdown was faster for red maple than water oak. PLFA revealed a significant time effect on microbial lipid profiles for both leaf species. Microbial assemblages on maple contained a higher relative abundance of bacterial lipids than oak, and oak microbial assemblages contained higher relative abundance of fungal lipids than maple. RISA showed that incubation time was more important in structuring bacterial assemblages than leaf physicochemistry. DGGE profiles revealed high variability in bacterial assemblages over time, and sequencing of DGGE-resolved amplicons indicated several taxa present on degrading litter. Next-generation sequencing revealed temporal shifts in dominant taxa within the phylum Proteobacteria, whereas γ-Proteobacteria dominated pre-immersion and α- and β-Proteobacteria dominated after 1 month of instream incubation; the latter groups contain taxa that are predicted to be capable of using organic material to fuel further breakdown. Our results suggest that incubation time is more important than leaf species physicochemistry in influencing leaf litter microbial assemblage composition, and indicate the need for investigation into seasonal and temporal dynamics of leaf litter microbial assemblage succession.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Previous studies have provided the conceptual realization that microbiomes are dynamic among hosts and the intimacy of relation between micro- and macroorganisms. Here, we present an intestinal microflora community analysis for members of the order Chiroptera and investigate the relative influence of variables in shaping observed microbiome relationships. The variables ranged from those considered to have ancient and long-term influences (host phylogeny and life history) to the relatively transient variable of host reproductive condition. In addition, collection locality data, representing the geographic variable, were included in analyses. Results indicate a complex influence of variables in shaping sample relationships in which signal for host phylogeny is recovered at broad taxonomic levels (family), whereas intrafamilial analyses disclosed various degrees of resolution for the remaining variables. Although cumulative probabilities of assignment indicated both reproductive condition and geography influenced relationships, comparison of ecological measures among groups revealed statistical differences between most variable classifications. For example, ranked ecological diversity was associated with host phylogeny (deeper coalescences among families were associated with more microfloral diversity), dietary strategy (herbivory generally retained higher diversity than carnivory) and reproductive condition (reproductively active females displayed more diverse microflora than nonreproductive conditions). Overall, the results of this study describe a complex process shaping microflora communities of wildlife species as well as provide avenues for future research that will further inform the nature of symbiosis between microflora communities and hosts.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Whole genome analysis of several strains has revealed a broad glycolytic and proteolytic potential. In this study, we used a targeted metagenomic approach to investigate the degradation capabilities of distinct Bacteroidetes clades from two contrasting regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Polar Biome (BPLR) and the North Atlantic Subtropical (NAST). We present here the analysis of 76 Bacteroidetes fosmids, of which 28 encode the 16S rRNA gene as phylogenetic marker, and their comparison to complete Bacteroidetes genomes. Almost all of the 16S rRNA harbouring fosmids belonged to clades that we previously identified in BPLR and NAST. The majority of sequenced fosmids could be assigned to Bacteroidetes affiliated with the class Flavobacteria. We also present novel genomic information on the classes Cytophagia and Sphingobacteria, suggesting a capability of the latter for attachment to algal surfaces. In our fosmid set we identified a larger potential for polysaccharide degradation and cell surface attachment in the phytoplankton-rich BPLR. Particularly, two flavobacterial fosmids, one affiliated with the genus Polaribacter, showed a whole armoury of enzymes that likely function in degradation of sulfated polysaccharides known to be major constituents of phytoplankton cell walls. Genes involved in protein and peptidoglycan degradation, although present in both fosmid sets, seemed to have a slight preponderance in NAST. This study provides support for the hypothesis of a distinct specialization among marine Bacteroidetes for the degradation of certain types of polymers.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Metagenomic Evidence for the Presence of Comammox Nitrospira-Like Bacteria in a Drinking Water System,PRJNA104935,30/12/2015,"Ameet J Pinto,Lutgarde Raskin","Ameet J Pinto 1, Daniel N Marcus 2, Umer Zeeshan Ijaz 1, Quyen Melina Bautista-de Lose Santos 1, Gregory J Dick 3, Lutgarde Raskin 4",mSphere,"Water Microbiology,water pollution,Food safety",10.1128/mSphere.00054-15,,"We report metagenomic evidence for the presence of a Nitrospira-like organism with the metabolic potential to perform the complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate (i.e., it is a complete ammonia oxidizer [comammox]) in a drinking water system. This metagenome bin was discovered through shotgun DNA sequencing of samples from biologically active filters at the drinking water treatment plant in Ann Arbor, MI. Ribosomal proteins, 16S rRNA, and nxrA gene analyses confirmed that this genome is related to Nitrospira-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. The presence of the full suite of ammonia oxidation genes, including ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase, on a single ungapped scaffold within this metagenome bin suggests the presence of recently discovered comammox potential. Evaluations based on coverage and k-mer frequency distribution, use of two different genome-binning approaches, and nucleic acid and protein similarity analyses support the presence of this scaffold within the Nitrospira metagenome bin. The amoA gene found in this metagenome bin is divergent from those of canonical ammonia and methane oxidizers and clusters closely with the unusual amoA gene of comammox Nitrospira. This finding suggests that previously reported imbalances in abundances of nitrite- and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria/archaea may likely be explained by the capacity of Nitrospira-like organisms to completely oxidize ammonia. This finding might have significant implications for our understanding of microbially mediated nitrogen transformations in engineered and natural systems. IMPORTANCE Nitrification plays an important role in regulating the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen species in a range of environments, from drinking water and wastewater treatment plants to the oceans. Until recently, aerobic nitrification was considered to be a two-step process involving ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or archaea and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. This process requires close cooperation between these two functional guilds for complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate, without the accumulation of nitrite or other intermediates, such as nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. The discovery of a single organism with the potential to oxidize both ammonia and nitrite adds a new dimension to the current understanding of aerobic nitrification, while presenting opportunities to rethink nitrogen management in engineered systems.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Comparative analysis of the genes involved in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms revealed that heterotrophic processes (i.e., degradation of carbohydrates, hydrocarbons, and aromatics) are the most common microbial metabolisms in the seawater, while chemolithoautotrophic metabolisms such as ammonia oxidation with the HP/HB cycle for CO2 fixation probably dominated the surface sediment communities of the Yap Trench. Furthermore, abundant genes involved in stress response and metal resistance were both detected in the seawater and sediments, thus the enrichment of metal resistance genes is further hypothesized to be characteristic of the hadal microbial communities.

Additionally, full-length sequences and the structural, phylogenetic and molecular features of the possible TBVs were characterized using bioinformatics tools. The sequence run produced 12,254,268 reads and 6,667,259 unique reads from the tick pools. Further analysis of the viral reads revealed that 92.73% were similar to ssRNA viruses, and 90.5% of the total viral sequences belonged to Non-classified viral families. Of the 29 classified viral families, most virome sequences were homologous with vertebrate viruses from Circoviridae, plant viruses from Virgaviridae, phages from Microviridae, insect viruses from Baculoviridae, and giant viruses from Mimiviridae. In the process of assembly of reads, large contigs representing four virus families were identified, including Phenuiviridae, Chuviridae, Parvoviridae and Non-classified families. Some sequences of Non-classified family shared a highly divergent amino acid sequence identities from existing virus sequences. The importance of these newly identified virus contigs to public and veterinary health needs additional researches. Because of the lack of the acquired viral reads from these families, we only demonstrated the complete sequences of Circoviridae in detail. The complete canine circovirus (CaCV)-NC21 genome detected from police dogs was 2,063 bp long with a GC content of 53.6%. Our results suggested that tick viromes collected from dogs contained diverse sequences with a broad range of animal, insect, plant, and phage viruses, which may reflect the ecological characteristics of the dogs and their ticks. Furthermore, our study revealed the existence of the partial contigs belonging to the four virus families in ticks. More researches are needed to verify their importance to public and veterinary health.

Probiotics are considered potential adjuvant therapies for liver disease. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 on acute liver injury and the underlying mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with L. helveticus R0052 suspensions (3 × 109 CFU) for 1 week. Subsequently, acute liver injury was induced by intraperitoneal D-galactosamine injection on the eighth day. After 24 h, samples (blood, liver, ileum, faeces) were collected and assessed for histological injury, inflammation, intestinal barrier, gut microbiome and metabolome. L. helveticus R0052 alleviated aminotransferase, bilirubin and total bile acid elevation and histological hepatic injuries. Additionally, L. helveticus R0052 exhibited anti-inflammatory properties by downregulating Toll-like receptors, tumour necrosis factor-α and nuclear factor-κb transcription in liver samples and decreasing proinflammatory cytokine plasma concentrations. Additionally, L. helveticus R0052 ameliorated intestinal abnormalities and regulated Toll-like receptors, claudin2 and mucin3 gene transcription in the intestine. These effects were associated with gut microbiome and metabolome modulation by L. helveticus R0052. Probiotic pretreatment enriched Lactobacillus and Bacteroides and depleted Flavonifractor and Acetatifactor in the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, L. helveticus R0052 improved carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism and reduced lithocholic acid levels. These results indicate that L. helveticus R0052 is promising for alleviating acute liver injury and provide new insights regarding the correlations among the microbiome, the metabolome, the intestinal barrier and liver disease.",,,Suraj Patel,

Testing the initial seed wash solutions of “Arka Vikas” and “Arka Abha” cultivars showed > 1000 bacterial cfu per dry seed, largely Bacillus spp. Tissue homogenates from surface-disinfected seeds did not show any cultivable bacteria on enriched media for 1–2 weeks, while 16S rRNA V3-V4 taxonomic profiling revealed a huge bacterial diversity (10–16 phyla per cultivar). Proteobacteria formed the dominant phylum (65.7–69.6% OTUs) followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and a notable share of Euryarchaeota (1.1–3.1%). Five more phyla appeared common to both cultivars in minor shares (Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Spirochaetes, Verrucomicrobia) with the ten phyla together constituting 99.6–99.9% OTUs. Class level and family level, the cultivars displayed elevated bacterial diversity, but similar taxonomic profiles. Arka Vikas and Arka Abha showed 114 and 107 genera, respectively, with 63 common genera constituting 96–97% OTUs. Psychrobacter formed the dominant genus. Bacillus and related genera constituted only negligible OTU share (0.16–0.28%). KEGG functional analysis showed metabolism as the major bacterial community role. One-month-old in vitro seedlings showed the activation of some originally uncultivable bacteria uninfluenced by the OTU share.

In this study, an in ovo technique and a proteomics approach was used to address how early bacterial colonization in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) could modulate inflammatory and immune responses in young broilers. Embryos at 18 embryogenic days were inoculated with saline (S), 102 CFU of Citrobacter freundii (CF), Citrobacter species (C2), or lactic acid bacteria mixture (L) into the amnion. At 10 days posthatch, ileum samples from 12 birds per treatment were selected for tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Our further findings indicated that treatment-specific influences on early GIT microbiota resulted in different immune responses in mature broilers. Predicted functional analyses revealed activation of inflammation pathways in broilers treated in ovo with L and CF. Exposure to L enhanced functional annotation related to activation, trafficking of immune cells, and skeletal growth based-network, while CF inhibited biological functions associated with immune cell migration and inflammatory response. These results highlighted that proper immune function was dependent on specific GIT microbiota profiles, in which early-life exposure to L-based probiotic may have modulated the immune functions, whereas neonatal colonization of Enterobacteriaceae strains may have led to immune dysregulation associated with chronic inflammation.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

In this study, we used the in ovo technique as an experimental model to address how early bacterial intestinal colonization could affect the development and establishment of the mature ileal microbiota. Inoculations containing one of the following: 0.2 mL of 0.9% sterile saline (S), approximately 102 cells of Citrobacter freundii (CF), Citrobacter species (C2) or lactic acid bacteria mixture (L) were administered via in ovo into the amnion. Results showed that Enterobacteriaceae abundance was negatively correlated with aging, although its high population at day of hatch affected the microbiota composition, delaying mature microbiota establishment. L treatment increased colonization of butyrate-producing bacteria by 3 and 10 days, and segmented filamentous bacteria in the lower ileum by 10 days. On the other hand, L-probiotic decreased the population of Enterococcaceae. In addition, L and C2 microbial communities were less diverse at 10 than 3 days of age in the upper ileum. Importantly, these findings provide a valuable resource for a potential study model for interactions between microbial colonization and associated immune responses. In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that intestinal pioneer colonizers play a critical role in driving the course of microbial community composition and diversity over time, in which early life exposure to L-based probiotic supported selection alongside greater colonization of symbiotic populations in the ileum of young broilers.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

These caterpillars are able to ingest and metabolize polyethylene at unprecedented rates. While it appears that G. mellonella plays an important role in the biodegradation process, the contribution of its intestinal microbiome remains poorly understood and contested. In a series of experiments, we present strong evidence of an intricate relationship between an intact microbiome, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) biodegradation and the production of glycol as a metabolic by-product. First, we biochemically confirmed that G. mellonella larvae consume and metabolize LDPE, as individual caterpillars fed on polyethylene excreted glycol, but those excretions were reduced by antibiotic treatment. Further, while the gut bacterial communities remained relatively stable regardless of diet, we showed that during the early phases of feeding on LDPE (24–72 h), caterpillars exhibited increased microbial abundance relative to those starved or fed on their natural honeycomb diet. Finally, by isolating and growing gut bacteria with polyethylene as their exclusive carbon source for over 1 year, we identified microorganisms in the genus Acinetobacter that appeared to be involved in this biodegradation process. Taken collectively, our study indicates that during short-term exposure, the intestinal microbiome of G. mellonella is intricately associated with polyethylene biodegradation in vivo.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

We demonstrate that targeting of 16S variable regions with short-read sequencing platforms cannot achieve the taxonomic resolution afforded by sequencing the entire (~1500 bp) gene. We further demonstrate that full-length sequencing platforms are sufficiently accurate to resolve subtle nucleotide substitutions (but not insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation between 16S gene copies.

Deep sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that two ionophores drastically reduced a number of rare bacteria resulting in a significant decrease in richness and a concomitant increase in evenness of the cecal microbiota, whereas three antibiotics had no obvious impact. Although each AGP modulated the gut microbiota differently, the closer the antibacterial spectrum of AGPs, the more similarly the microbiota was regulated. Importantly, all AGPs had a strong tendency to enrich butyrate- and lactic acid-producing bacteria, while reducing bile salt hydrolase-producing bacteria, suggestive of enhanced metabolism and utilization of dietary carbohydrates and lipids and improved energy harvest, which may collectively be responsible for the growth-promoting effect of AGPs.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Results: Offspring from dams in the HD-inulin groups demonstrated reduced fasting blood glucose, decreased blood glucose area under the curve during the oral glucose tolerance test, and reduced fasting serum insulin and HOMA-IR compared to offspring from dams in the HD group. Nineteen differentially abundant bacterial species were identified between the HD-inulin and HD groups. The HD-inulin group displayed significantly greater abundances of Bacteroides_acidifaciens, Eubacterium_sp_CAG_786, Clostridium_sp_CAG_343, and Bifidobacterium_breve species and lower abundances of Oscillibacter_sp_1_3, Ruminococcus_gnavus_CAG_126, and Bacteroides_massiliensis species. Differentially abundant bacterial species among the three groups were involved in 38 metabolic pathways, including several glucose and lipid metabolism pathways.

Conclusion: Our results show that early inulin intervention in HD-fed mouse dams moderates offspring glucose metabolism and gut dysbiosis.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

We use a decomposition experiment anchoring standardized sections of wood from a single tree species along replicated gradients of salinity, and in adjacent terrestrial habitats. Large differences in fungal communities at the order and phylum-level were observed in this study, consistent with previous taxonomic studies of aquatic fungi. We show that these compositional differences are associated with marked differences in wood elemental concentrations and in the loss rates of wood polymers, indicating that a combination of biotic and abiotic factors associated with habitat can drive differences in decay processes.

How carrion may affect soil microbial biodiversity and ecosystem processes in natural systems is comparatively unknown, but is important for the intersection of vertebrate food webs, below‐ground processes and ecological heterogeneity.
We assessed in situ soil and plant responses to wolf‐killed mammal carrion in Yellowstone National Park, USA.
Bison and elk carcasses increased soil respiration and vegetation nutrient concentration and the carcasses contain altered bacterial and fungal communities compared to control plots. The ‘fingerprints’ of soil microbial taxa associated with bison compared to elk carcasses differed considerably and taxa are found dependent upon abiotic gradients and soil properties.
We found evidence that soil microbial community changes associated with carcasses may not be as generalizable as previously thought, which is important for a mechanistic understanding of the links between carrion and soil heterogeneity and potentially for applications in forensic science.
This work demonstrates the importance of carrion studies in natural systems. Our findings show that carrion creates distinct ecological patterns that contribute to both above‐ and below‐ground biological heterogeneity, linking carrion distribution dynamics with soil microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

We found that MNPs accelerated methanogenesis in agitated cultures as has been observed previously for static cultures. Metabarcoding of 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed that Methanosarcina substantially increased in the presence of MNPs, while DIET-related Geobacter did not occur. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses confirmed the predominance of Methanosarcina in MPN-supplemented cultures. In addition, genes coding for acetoclastic methanogenesis but not those for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were abundantly expressed in the dominant Methanosarcina in the presence of MNPs.

However, how the intestinal microbiota responds to a long sea voyage and whether there is a feasible approach for protecting gut health during sea voyage are still unexplored. Here, we designed a 30-d longitudinal study including a placebo group (n = 42) and a probiotic group (n = 40) and used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to explore the impacts of sea voyage on the intestinal microbiome of sailors. By comparing the intestinal microbiome of subjects in the placebo group at baseline (d 0) and at the end of the sea voyage (d 30), we observed an alteration in the intestinal microbiome during the long sea voyage based on the microbial structure; the results revealed an increase in the species Streptococcus gordonii and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as a decrease in some functional features. However, the change in the microbial structure of sailors in the probiotic group between d 0 and d 30 was limited, which indicated a maintenance effect of probiotics on intestinal microbiome homeostasis. At the metagenomic strain level, a generally positive correlation was observed between probiotics and the strains belonging to Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium animalis, whereas a common negative correlation was observed between probiotics and Clostridium leptum; this result revealed the potential mechanism of maintaining intestinal microbiome homeostasis by probiotics.

We examined the diversity of wild-caught black blow fly endogenous (internal body) and exogenous (external body) microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, 27 phyla, 171 families and 533 genera were detected, and diversity was significantly higher (P < 0.05) on external body surfaces. At the genus level, Dysgonomonas, Ignatzschineria, Acinetobacter, Vagococcus, Myroides, and Wohlfahrtiimonas were predominant. Cloning and sequencing of nearly full-length fragments of the 16S rRNA gene showed that some of the species identified are known to be pathogenic to humans, animals, and plants. Myroides odoratimimus and Acinetobacter radioresistens are well-known, multi-drug resistant bacteria.

Here, we tested whether manipulating the uropygial gland microbial community affects chemical profiles in the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We found an effect of antibiotic treatment targeting the uropygial gland on both bacterial and volatile profiles. In a second experiment, we cultured bacteria from junco preen oil, and found that all of the cultivars produced at least one volatile compound common in junco preen oil, and that most cultivars produced multiple preen oil volatiles.

This phenomenon, termed phylosymbiosis, has been observed in diverse evolutionary lineages, but has been difficult to detect in birds. Previous tests of phylosymbiosis among birds have been conducted using wild individuals, and thus interspecific differences in diet and environment may have masked a phylogenetic signal. Therefore, we tested for phylosymbiosis among all 15 species of cranes (family Gruidae) housed in the same captive environment and maintained on identical diets. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that crane species harbour distinct gut microbiota. Overall, we detected marginally significant patterns of phylosymbiosis, the strength of which was increased when including the estimates of absolute microbial abundance (rather than relative abundance) derived from microbial densities determined by flow cytometry. Using this approach, we detected the statistically significant signatures of phylosymbiosis only after removing male cranes from our analysis, suggesting that using mixed-sex animal cohorts may prevent the detection of phylosymbiosis. Though weak compared with mammals (and especially insects), these results provide evidence of phylosymbiosis in birds.

Lateritic soils form through weathering and deliver abundant iron (oxy)hydroxides but very little sulfate to the lake and its sediment. To characterize the sediment biogeochemistry, we collected cores at three sites with increasing water depth and decreasing bottom water oxygen concentrations. Microbial cell densities were highest at the shallow site—a feature we attribute to the availability of labile organic matter (OM) and the higher abundance of electron acceptors due to oxic bottom water conditions. At the two other sites, OM degradation and reduction processes below the oxycline led to partial electron acceptor depletion.

Microbial cell densities were highest at the shallow site—a feature we attribute to the availability of labile organic matter (OM) and the higher abundance of electron acceptors due to oxic bottom water conditions. At the two other sites, OM degradation and reduction processes below the oxycline led to partial electron acceptor depletion. Genetic information preserved in the sediment as extracellular DNA (eDNA) provided information on aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs related to Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, and Thermoplasmatales. These taxa apparently played a significant role in the degradation of sinking OM. However, eDNA concentrations rapidly decreased with core depth. Despite very low sulfate concentrations, sulfate-reducing bacteria were present and viable in sediments at all three sites, as confirmed by measurement of potential sulfate reduction rates. Microbial community fingerprinting supported the presence of taxa related to Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes with demonstrated capacity for iron and sulfate reduction. Concomitantly, sequences of Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, and Methanomicrobiales indicated potential for fermentative hydrogen and methane production. Such first insights into ferruginous sediments showed that microbial populations perform successive metabolisms related to sulfur, iron, and methane.

A metagenomic study was initiated to help diagnose the causes for the bioreactor’s poor operation. Despite being inoculated with a custom consortium of Pseudomonas strains capable of nitrate and selenate reduction, the microbial community shifted towards dominance by Trichococcus- and Candidatus Saccharibacteria- related species. Metagenomic assembled genomes for these revealed that they did not have the metabolic potential for denitrification or selenate reduction, and displayed an affinity for carbohydrate carbon sources through the PTS pathway. We speculate that the sugar-based carbon sources fed to the bioreactor lead to favourable growth of the filamentous forms of these species under the conditions of the bioreactor, which may have allowed for infiltration of oxygen. Decreasing ORP coincided with decrease in relative abundance of the filamentous species and increase in relative abundance of uncharacterized species in the Burkholderiales and Rhodocyclales orders with the metabolic potential for all steps of the denitrification pathway including nitrate reductases closely related to those with an affinity for selenate as well as nitrate.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

We assessed how PPI treatment alters the fecal microbiota and whether treatment promotes CDIs in a mouse model. Mice receiving a PPI treatment were gavaged with 40 mg of omeprazole per kg of body weight during a 7-day pretreatment phase, the day of C. difficile challenge, and the following 9 days. We found that mice treated with omeprazole were not colonized by C. difficile. When omeprazole treatment was combined with a single clindamycin treatment, one cage of mice remained resistant to C. difficile colonization, while the other cage was colonized. Treating mice with only clindamycin followed by challenge resulted in C. difficile colonization. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that omeprazole had minimal impact on the structure of the murine microbiota throughout the 16 days of omeprazole exposure. These results suggest that omeprazole treatment alone is not sufficient to disrupt microbiota resistance to C. difficile infection in mice that are normally resistant in the absence of antibiotic treatment.",mSphere-2019-Tomkovich-e00693-19_full.pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a73376bf37dce5c7b29278e7a3f6bf3a/c935f2de/mSphere-2019-Tomkovich-e00693-19_full.pdf),,Suraj Patel,

The bacterial and fungal composition of dental plaque and how children’s sex is associated with S-ECC are largely unknown. In this study, V4-16S rRNA and ITS1 rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to compare the plaque bacteriome and mycobiome of children <72 mo of age: 40 with S-ECC (15 males, 25 females) and 40 caries-free (19 males, 21 females). Health- and nutrition-related questionnaire data were also investigated. This study aimed to analyze potential sex-based differences in the supragingival plaque microbiota of young children with S-ECC and those caries-free. Behavioral and nutritional habit differences were observed between children with S-ECC and those caries-free and between male and female children. Overall, higher levels of Veillonella dispar, Streptococcus mutans, and other bacterial species were found in the S-ECC group as compared with caries-free controls (P < 0.05). A significant difference in the abundance of Neisseria was observed between males and females with S-ECC (P < .05). Fungal taxonomic analysis showed significantly higher levels of Candida dubliniensis in the plaque of children with S-ECC as compared with those caries-free (P < 0.05), but no differences were observed with Candida albicans (P > 0.05). Significant differences in the relative abundance of Mycosphaerella, Cyberlindnera, and Trichosporon fungal species were also observed between the caries-free and S-ECC groups (P < 0.05). Machine learning analysis revealed the most important bacterial and fungal species for classifying S-ECC versus caries-free. Different patterns of crosstalk between microbial species were observed between male and female children. Our work demonstrates that plaque microbiota and sex may be important determinants for S-ECC and could be factors to consider for inclusion in caries risk assessment tools.",,16S/ITS Amplicon,Suraj Patel,

possible role in health and disease. Fungi and bacteria colonise the infant gastrointestinal tract in parallel, yet most
infant microbiome studies have ignored fungi. Milk is a source of diverse and viable bacteria, but few studies have
assessed the diversity of fungi in human milk.
Results: Here we profiled mycobiota in milk from 271 mothers in the CHILD birth cohort and detected fungi in 58
(21.4%). Samples containing detectable fungi were dominated by Candida, Alternaria, and Rhodotorula, and had
lower concentrations of two human milk oligosaccharides (disialyllacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-hexaose). The
presence of milk fungi was associated with multiple outdoor environmental features (city, population density,
and season), maternal atopy, and early-life antibiotic exposure. In addition, despite a strong positive correlation
between bacterial and fungal richness, there was a co-exclusion pattern between the most abundant fungus
(Candida) and most of the core bacterial genera.
Conclusion: We profiled human milk mycobiota in a well-characterised cohort of mother-infant dyads and provide
evidence of possible host-environment interactions in fungal inoculation. Further research is required to establish
the role of breastfeeding in delivering fungi to the developing infant, and to assess the health impact of the milk
microbiota in its entirety, including both bacterial and fungal components.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

In this study, we applied a high-throughput sequencing approach to examine the presence of picornaviruses in penguins from King George Island, Antarctica. We discovered and characterized a novel picornavirus from cloacal swab samples of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), which we tentatively named Pingu virus. Also, using RT-PCR we detected this virus in 12.9 per cent of cloacal swabs derived from P. papua, but not in samples from adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) or chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus). Attempts to isolate the virus in a chicken cell line and in embryonated chicken eggs were unsuccessful.

traces in a given environmental sample. In some cases, it is sufficient to determine the origin of an environmental sample, rather than being able to accurately identify the organisms living there (which may be a challenging
task). For example, in forensic soil analysis, it could be possible to confirm or exclude that a defendant was
present in a certain place by comparing a soil sample acquired from his belongings against the samples derived
from a variety of places (including the suspected place). In this paper, we present a method to identify the
environmental origins of metagenomic reads by comparing them with entire metagenomic collections derived
from reference samples. For this purpose, we exploit our CoMeta program, which allows for fast classification
of metagenome samples, and we apply it to classify the extracted soil metagenomes to various collections of
soil samples. The experimental results reported in this paper indicate that the proposed approach is effective,

The PAMPA datasets: a metagenomic survey of microbial communities in Argentinean pampean soils,PRJNA178180,29/7/2013,"Nicolás Rascovan,Martín P Vazquez","Nicolás Rascovan, Belén Carbonetto, Santiago Revale, Marina D Reinert, Roberto Alvarez, Alicia M Godeas, Roxana Colombo, Mario Aguilar, María Victoria Novas, Leopoldo Iannone, Alicia M Zelada, Alejandro Pardo, Gustavo Schrauf, Alejandro Mentaberry & Martín P Vazquez",BMC Microbiology,"soil,soil metagenome,Metagenome,unclassified sequences,Sequence Classification",https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2049-2618-1-21,,"Background
Soil is among the most diverse and complex environments in the world. Soil microorganisms play an essential role in biogeochemical cycles and affect plant growth and crop production. However, our knowledge of the relationship between species-assemblies and soil ecosystem processes is still very limited. The aim of this study was to generate a comprehensive metagenomic survey to evaluate the effect of high-input agricultural practices on soil microbial communities.

Results
We collected soil samples from three different areas in the Argentinean Pampean region under three different types of land uses and two soil sources (bulk and rhizospheric). We extracted total DNA from all samples and also synthetized cDNA from rhizospheric samples. Using 454-FLX technology, we generated 112 16S ribosomal DNA and 14 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon libraries totaling 1.3 M reads and 36 shotgun metagenome libraries totaling 17.8 million reads (7.7 GB). Our preliminary results suggested that water availability could be the primary driver that defined microbial assemblages over land use and soil source. However, when water was not a limiting resource (annual precipitation >800 mm) land use was a primary driver.

Conclusion
This was the first metagenomic study of soil conducted in Argentina and our datasets are among the few large soil datasets publicly available. The detailed analysis of these data will provide a step forward in our understanding of how soil microbiomes respond to high-input agricultural systems, and they will serve as a useful comparison with other soil metagenomic studies worldwide.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Findings: Using pyrosequencing-based molecular monitoring of bacterial 16S rRNA gene from eight tumor/normal tissue pairs of eight Chinese CRC patients, we analyzed and characterized the basic features of the CRC-associated microbiome. Firstly, we discovered an increasing diversity among tumor-associated bacterial communities. Secondly, in 50% of Chinese CRC patients, we found a significant increase of Roseburia (P = 0.017), and a concurrent decrease of both Microbacterium (P = 0.009) and Anoxybacillus (P = 0.009) in tumor tissue.

Conclusions: We discovered a novel CRC microbiome pattern in Chinese. Both the over-represented Roseburia bacteria at tumor sites and the over-represented Microbacterium and Anoxybacillus bacteria away from tumor sites were both closely related in Chinese CRC patients. Across several populations reported in this study and previously, we observed both common and distinctive patterns of human CRC microbiome's association with a high-risk of CRC.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,
Functional metagenomic investigations of microbial communities in a shallow-sea hydrothermal system,PRJNA178514,6/8/2013,"Kai Tang,Chen-Tung Arthur Chen","Kai Tang ,Keshao Liu,Nianzhi Jiao ,Yao Zhang,Chen-Tung Arthur Chen",Plos One,"Metagenome,Search Algorithm,Seawater,seawater metagenome",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072958,,"Little is known about the functional capability of microbial communities in shallow-sea hydrothermal systems (water depth of <200 m). This study analyzed two high-throughput pyrosequencing metagenomic datasets from the vent and the surface water in the shallow-sea hydrothermal system offshore NE Taiwan. This system exhibited distinct geochemical parameters. Metagenomic data revealed that the vent and the surface water were predominated by Epsilonproteobacteria (Nautiliales-like organisms) and Gammaproteobacteria (Thiomicrospira-like organisms), respectively. A significant difference in microbial carbon fixation and sulfur metabolism was found between the vent and the surface water. The chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the vent and in the surface water might possess the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle and the Calvin−Bassham−Benson cycle for carbon fixation in response to carbon dioxide highly enriched in the environment, which is possibly fueled by geochemical energy with sulfur and hydrogen. Comparative analyses of metagenomes showed that the shallow-sea metagenomes contained some genes similar to those present in other extreme environments. This study may serve as a basis for deeply understanding the genetic network and functional capability of the microbial members of shallow-sea hydrothermal systems.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

An important data gap however, that remains poorly studied is the baseline description of microflora that may be associated with plant anatomy either endemically or in response to environmental pressures. Specific anatomical niches of plants may contribute to persistence of human pathogens in agricultural environments in ways we have yet to describe. Tomatoes have been implicated in outbreaks of Salmonella at least 17 times during the years spanning 1990 to 2010. Our research seeks to provide a baseline description of the tomato microbiome and possibly identify whether or not there is something distinctive about tomatoes or their growing ecology that contributes to persistence of Salmonella in this important food crop.

Results: DNA was recovered from washes of epiphytic surfaces of tomato anatomical organs; leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits of Solanum lycopersicum (BHN602), grown at a site in close proximity to commercial farms previously implicated in tomato-Salmonella outbreaks. DNA was amplified for targeted 16S and 18S rRNA genes and sheared for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Amplicons and metagenomes were used to describe ""native"" bacterial microflora for diverse anatomical parts of Virginia-grown tomatoes.

Conclusions: Distinct groupings of microbial communities were associated with different tomato plant organs and a gradient of compositional similarity could be correlated to the distance of a given plant part from the soil. Unique bacterial phylotypes (at 95% identity) were associated with fruits and flowers of tomato plants. These include Microvirga, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Brachybacterium, Rhizobiales, Paracocccus, Chryseomonas and Microbacterium. The most frequently observed bacterial taxa across aerial plant regions were Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas. Dominant fungal taxa that could be identified to genus with 18S amplicons included Hypocrea, Aureobasidium and Cryptococcus. No definitive presence of Salmonella could be confirmed in any of the plant samples, although 16S sequences suggested that closely related genera were present on leaves, fruits and roots.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Molecular diversity, and biogeochemistry of hypersaline microbial mats, rhizome-associated concretions, and an endoevaporite were compared with: The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by pyrosequencing to analyze the total microbial diversity (i.e., bacteria and archaea) in bulk samples, and in addition, in detail on a millimeter scale in one microbial mat and in one evaporite. Archaea were more abundant than bacteria. Euryarchaeota was one of the most abundant phyla in all samples, and particularly dominant (97% of total diversity) in the most lithified ecosystem, the evaporite. Most of the euryarchaeal OTUs could be assigned to the class Halobacteria or anaerobic and methanogenic archaea. Planctomycetes potentially also play a key role in mats and rhizome-associated concretions, notably the aerobic organoheterotroph members of the class Phycisphaerae. In addition to cyanobacteria, members of Chromatiales and possibly the candidate family Chlorotrichaceae contributed to photosynthetic carbon fixation. Other abundant uncultured taxa such as the candidate division MSBL1, the uncultured MBGB, and the phylum Acetothermia potentially play an important metabolic role in these ecosystems. Lithifying microbial mats contained calcium carbonate precipitates, whereas endoevoporites consisted of gypsum, and halite. Biogeochemical measurements revealed that based on depth profiles of O2 and sulfide, metabolic activities were much higher in the non-lithifying mat (peaking in the least lithified systems) than in lithifying mats with the lowest activity in endoevaporites. This trend in decreasing microbial activity reflects the increase in salinity, which may play an important role in the biodiversity.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Koshiq Hossain,

They also harbour extensive microbial communities, with many microbial phylotypes found exclusively in sponge hosts and not in the seawater or surrounding environment, i.e. so-called sponge-specific clusters (SCs) or sponge- and coral-specific clusters (SCCs). We employed DNA (16S rRNA gene) and RNA (16S rRNA)-based amplicon pyrosequencing to investigate the effects of sublethal thermal stress on the bacterial biosphere of the Great Barrier Reef sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile. A total of 8381 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (97% sequence similarity) were identified, affiliated with 32 bacterial phyla from seawater samples, 23 bacterial phyla from sponge DNA extracts and 18 bacterial phyla from sponge RNA extracts. Sublethal thermal stress (31°C) had no effect on the present and/or active portions of the R. odorabile bacterial community but a shift in the bacterial assemblage was observed in necrotic sponges. Over two-thirds of DNA and RNA sequences could be assigned to previously defined SCs/SCCs in healthy sponges whereas only 12% of reads from necrotic sponges could be assigned to SCs/SCCs. A rapid decline in host health over a 1°C temperature increment suggests that sponges such as R. odorabile may be highly vulnerable to the effects of global climate change.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Comparative metagenomics of coalbed methane microbial communities reveals biogenic methane potential in the Appalachian Basin,PRJNA183934,,,,bioRxiv,,https://doi.org/10.1101/319590,,"Natural gas is a major source of global energy, and a large fraction is generated in subsurface coalbed deposits. Microbial communities within coalbed deposits impact methane production, and as a result contribute to global carbon cycling. The process of biogenic coal-to-methane conversion is not well understood. Here we demonstrate the first read- and assembly-based metagenome profiling of coal-associated formation waters, resulting in the recovery of over 40 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from eight individual coalbed methane wells in the Appalachian Basin. The majority of samples contained hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which were present in higher relative abundances than was previously reported for other coalbed basins. The abundance of Archaea and salinity were positively correlated, suggesting that salinity may be a controlling factor for biogenic coalbed methane. Low-abundance coalbed microbial populations were functionally diverse, while the most dominant organisms exhibit a high degree of genomic and functional similarities. Basin-specific pan-metagenome clustering suggests lower abundant and diverse bacterial communities are shaped by local basin parameters. Our analyses show Appalachian Basin coalbed microbial communities encode for the potential to convert coal into methane, which may be used as an indicator of potential biogenic methane production for future well performance and increased well longevity.

Methane is an important fossil energy resource in the global energy landscape. As conventional natural gas resources become depleted, unconventional gas technologies will emerge with greater importance for global energy security. One unconventional gas technology is coalbed methane (CBM), which relies on underutilized natural methane repositories trapped in subsurface coalbeds. CBM wells provide access to subsurface methane deposits at a reduced cost and environmental impact relative to traditional mining practices 1.

An estimated 40% of U.S.-based CBM is biogenic2,3, and recently, there has been a growing interest in understanding microbial communities in coalbed deposits, as these communities may be potential indicators of productive CBM wells or utilized to enhance in situ production of methane.4 Research in this area has offered insight into unique subsurface microbial pathways that affect methane production and ultimately, the global energy supply and global carbon cycling. Biological conversion of coal to methane is complex and requires multiple enzymatic steps, performed by a diverse set of microorganisms, including hydrocarbon degraders and methanogens5—unraveling these pathways, and the associated diverse community of microorganisms, is paramount to understanding biogenic methane production.

Much of what is known about coalbed microbial communities has been derived from 16S rRNA gene sequencing6–8, which provides important information about microbial community structure and diversity, but lacks functional data required for detailed metagenomic analyses. A limited number of studies have provided valuable insight into the metabolic potential of CBM systems using metagenomics9,10. However, these studies are limited to the western (Alberta Basin, Powder River Basin, and the San Juan Basin) and interior basins (Illinois Basin), neglecting large coalbed basins in the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Basin. The Appalachian Basin is an energy rich expanse that stretches from New York to Alabama and according to the newest EIA report is one of the most productive energy regions in the nation (www.eia.gov).

To characterize the unknown microbial community in the eastern US coal basin and gain insight in its potential for biogenic methane production, we present the first metagenomic investigation of Appalachian Basin coalbeds and the first coalbed-focused pan-genomic comparison across geographically distinct regions. Findings from this study provide 1) a read-based and assembly-centric taxonomic profiling of the previously uncharacterized microbial communities, 2) the first Appalachian Basin coalbed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), 3) functional potential characterization of coalbed microbial communities extant in the Appalachian Basin, and 4) a taxonomic and functional comparison of Appalachian Basin metagenomes to microbial communities from geographically distinct coalbeds. Our results demonstrate the Appalachian Basin to be distinct from previously characterized basins, specifically an abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens from the Order Methanomicrobiales, suggesting a novel subsurface environment that could be targeted for methane production and contributes to unknown amounts of carbon cycling. We show abundant populations were highly conserved across geographically distinct coalbed basins while low-abundance microorganisms were functionally diverse within and across coal basins. This work provides a framework for understanding subsurface microbial metabolisms and the potential for coal to methane conversion, which can be utilized as an indicator for the potential to recover methane from unmined areas, and enable the development for microbial enhanced coalbed methane strategies in the Appalachian Basin.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Nitritation versus full nitrification of ammonium-rich wastewater: Comparison in terms of nitrous and nitric oxides emissions,PRJNA185475,1/7/2013,"A.Rodriguez-Caballero,M.Pijuan",A.Rodriguez-CaballeroA.RiberaJ.L.BalcázarM.Pijuan,Elsevier,"nitrogen fixing,nitrate,pollinators,pollination",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.04.021,,"The processes of nitritation and full nitrification of synthetic reject wastewater were compared in terms of N2O and NO emissions. Two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBR1 and SBR2) were enriched with Nitrosomonas (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) and Nitrobacter (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria), as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-resolution 16S rRNA tag pyrosequencing. Stable conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate was achieved in SBR1 and SBR2 respectively. Biomass from SBR2 was added in SBR1 in order to achieve full nitrification. Under nitritation, 1.22% of the converted-N was emitted as N2O, and 0.066% as NO. During the transition from nitritation to full nitrification, effluent nitrite concentrations decreased but nitrogen oxides were emitted at levels similar to the nitritation period. Gas emissions decreased sharply under full nitrification conditions (0.54% N2O-N/converted-N; 0.021% NO-N/converted-N), probably as a result of the combined effect of lower nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the bioreactor.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,
Prevalence of Antibiotic Resistance Genes and Bacterial Community Composition in a River Influenced by a Wastewater Treatment Plant,PRJNA185477,25/10/2013,"Elisabet Marti,Jose Luis Balcazar","Elisabet Marti,Juan Jofre,Jose Luis Balcazar ",Plos One,"16S RNA,16S rRNA,Antibiotic,β-lactam resistance",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078906,,"Antibiotic resistance represents a global health problem, requiring better understanding of the ecology of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), their selection and their spread in the environment. Antibiotics are constantly released to the environment through wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. We investigated, therefore, the effect of these discharges on the prevalence of ARGs and bacterial community composition in biofilm and sediment samples of a receiving river. We used culture-independent approaches such as quantitative PCR to determine the prevalence of eleven ARGs and 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing to examine the composition of bacterial communities. Concentration of antibiotics in WWTP influent and effluent were also determined. ARGs such as qnrS, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, erm(B), sul(I), sul(II), tet(O) and tet(W) were detected in all biofilm and sediment samples analyzed. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the relative abundance of ARGs in biofilm samples collected downstream of the WWTP discharge. We also found significant differences with respect to community structure and composition between upstream and downstream samples. Therefore, our results indicate that WWTP discharges may contribute to the spread of ARGs into the environment and may also impact on the bacterial communities of the receiving river.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Koshiq Hossain,

Genomic properties of Marine Group A bacteria indicate a role in the marine sulfur cycle,PRJNA189692,8/2/2014,"Jody J Wright,Steven J Hallam","Jody J Wright 1, Keith Mewis 2, Niels W Hanson 3, Kishori M Konwar 1, Kendra R Maas 1, Steven J Hallam 4",ISME,"marine,Genome,genome-resolved metagenomics,marine metagenome",10.1038/ismej.2013.152,,"Marine Group A (MGA) is a deeply branching and uncultivated phylum of bacteria. Although their functional roles remain elusive, MGA subgroups are particularly abundant and diverse in oxygen minimum zones and permanent or seasonally stratified anoxic basins, suggesting metabolic adaptation to oxygen-deficiency. Here, we expand a previous survey of MGA diversity in O2-deficient waters of the Northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean (NESAP) to include Saanich Inlet (SI), an anoxic fjord with seasonal O2 gradients and periodic sulfide accumulation. Phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene clone libraries recovered five previously described MGA subgroups and defined three novel subgroups (SHBH1141, SHBH391, and SHAN400) in SI. To discern the functional properties of MGA residing along gradients of O2 in the NESAP and SI, we identified and sequenced to completion 14 fosmids harboring MGA-associated 16S RNA genes from a collection of 46 fosmid libraries sourced from NESAP and SI waters. Comparative analysis of these fosmids, in addition to four publicly available MGA-associated large-insert DNA fragments from Hawaii Ocean Time-series and Monterey Bay, revealed widespread genomic differentiation proximal to the ribosomal RNA operon that did not consistently reflect subgroup partitioning patterns observed in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Predicted protein-coding genes associated with adaptation to O2-deficiency and sulfur-based energy metabolism were detected on multiple fosmids, including polysulfide reductase (psrABC), implicated in dissimilatory polysulfide reduction to hydrogen sulfide and dissimilatory sulfur oxidation. These results posit a potential role for specific MGA subgroups in the marine sulfur cycle.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

Metagenomic Evidence for the Presence of Comammox Nitrospira-Like Bacteria in a Drinking Water System,PRJNA189999,30/12/2015,"Ameet J Pinto,Lutgarde Raskin","Ameet J Pinto 1, Daniel N Marcus 2, Umer Zeeshan Ijaz 1, Quyen Melina Bautista-de Lose Santos 1, Gregory J Dick 3, Lutgarde Raskin 4",mSphere,"Water Microbiology,water pollution,comammox",10.1128/mSphere.00054-15,,"We report metagenomic evidence for the presence of a Nitrospira-like organism with the metabolic potential to perform the complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate (i.e., it is a complete ammonia oxidizer [comammox]) in a drinking water system. This metagenome bin was discovered through shotgun DNA sequencing of samples from biologically active filters at the drinking water treatment plant in Ann Arbor, MI. Ribosomal proteins, 16S rRNA, and nxrA gene analyses confirmed that this genome is related to Nitrospira-like nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. The presence of the full suite of ammonia oxidation genes, including ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase, on a single ungapped scaffold within this metagenome bin suggests the presence of recently discovered comammox potential. Evaluations based on coverage and k-mer frequency distribution, use of two different genome-binning approaches, and nucleic acid and protein similarity analyses support the presence of this scaffold within the Nitrospira metagenome bin. The amoA gene found in this metagenome bin is divergent from those of canonical ammonia and methane oxidizers and clusters closely with the unusual amoA gene of comammox Nitrospira. This finding suggests that previously reported imbalances in abundances of nitrite- and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria/archaea may likely be explained by the capacity of Nitrospira-like organisms to completely oxidize ammonia. This finding might have significant implications for our understanding of microbially mediated nitrogen transformations in engineered and natural systems. IMPORTANCE Nitrification plays an important role in regulating the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen species in a range of environments, from drinking water and wastewater treatment plants to the oceans. Until recently, aerobic nitrification was considered to be a two-step process involving ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or archaea and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. This process requires close cooperation between these two functional guilds for complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate, without the accumulation of nitrite or other intermediates, such as nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. The discovery of a single organism with the potential to oxidize both ammonia and nitrite adds a new dimension to the current understanding of aerobic nitrification, while presenting opportunities to rethink nitrogen management in engineered systems.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

A leafhopper-transmissible DNA virus with novel evolutionary lineage in the family geminiviridae implicated in grapevine redleaf disease by next-generation sequencing,PRJNA190601,5/6/2013,"Sudarsana Poojari,Rayapati A Naidu","Sudarsana Poojari 1, Olufemi J Alabi, Viacheslav Y Fofanov, Rayapati A Naidu",Plos One,"DNA,insect gut metagenome,rDNA",10.1371/journal.pone.0064194,,"A graft-transmissible disease displaying red veins, red blotches and total reddening of leaves in red-berried wine grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars was observed in commercial vineyards. Next-generation sequencing technology was used to identify etiological agent(s) associated with this emerging disease, designated as grapevine redleaf disease (GRD). High quality RNA extracted from leaves of grape cultivars Merlot and Cabernet Franc with and without GRD symptoms was used to prepare cDNA libraries. Assembly of highly informative sequence reads generated from Illumina sequencing of cDNA libraries, followed by bioinformatic analyses of sequence contigs resulted in specific identification of taxonomically disparate viruses and viroids in samples with and without GRD symptoms. A single-stranded DNA virus, tentatively named Grapevine redleaf-associated virus (GRLaV), and Grapevine fanleaf virus were detected only in grapevines showing GRD symptoms. In contrast, Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus, Hop stunt viroid, Grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1, Citrus exocortis viroid and Citrus exocortis Yucatan viroid were present in both symptomatic and non-symptomatic grapevines. GRLaV was transmitted by the Virginia creeper leafhopper (Erythroneura ziczac Walsh) from grapevine-to-grapevine under greenhouse conditions. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses indicated that GRLaV, almost identical to recently reported Grapevine Cabernet Franc-associated virus from New York and Grapevine red blotch-associated virus from California, represents an evolutionarily distinct lineage in the family Geminiviridae with genome characteristics distinct from other leafhopper-transmitted geminiviruses. GRD significantly reduced fruit yield and affected berry quality parameters demonstrating negative impacts of the disease. Higher quantities of carbohydrates were present in symptomatic leaves suggesting their possible role in the expression of redleaf symptoms.",,Metagenomic,Koshiq Hossain,

The causality and pathogenic mechanism of microbiome composition remain elusive in many diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to elucidate gut microbiome’s role in RA pathology by a comprehensive metagenome-wide association study (MWAS).

Methods

We conducted MWAS of the RA gut microbiome in the Japanese population (n case=82, n control=42) by using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of high depth (average 13 Gb per sample). Our MWAS consisted of three major bioinformatic analytic pipelines (phylogenetic analysis, functional gene analysis and pathway analysis).

Results

Phylogenetic case–control association tests showed high abundance of multiple species belonging to the genus Prevotella (e.g., Prevotella denticola) in the RA case metagenome. The non-linear machine learning method efficiently deconvoluted the case–control phylogenetic discrepancy. Gene functional assessments showed that the abundance of one redox reaction-related gene (R6FCZ7) was significantly decreased in the RA metagenome compared with controls. A variety of biological pathways including those related to metabolism (e.g., fatty acid biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan degradation) were enriched in the case–control comparison. A population-specific link between the metagenome and host genome was identified by comparing biological pathway enrichment between the RA metagenome and the RA genome-wide association study results. No apparent discrepancy in alpha or beta diversities of metagenome was found between RA cases and controls.

Conclusion

Our shotgun sequencing-based MWAS highlights a novel link among the gut microbiome, host genome and pathology of RA, which contributes to our understanding of the microbiome’s role in RA aetiology.

The body-wide human microbiome plays a role in health, but its full diversity remains uncharacterized, particularly outside of the gut and in international populations. We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth.

Contrary to the existing methods for environmental classification that are based on taxonomic or functional classification, we rely on the similarity between a sample and the reference database computed at a reads level.

Results: We report the results of our extensive experimental study to investigate the behavior of our method and its sensitivity to different parameters. In our tests, we have followed the protocol of the MetaSUB Challenge, which allowed us to compare the obtained results with the solutions based on taxonomic and functional classification.

Conclusions: The results reported in the paper indicate that our method is competitive with those based on taxonomic classification. Importantly, by measuring the similarity at the reads level, we avoid the necessity of using large databases with annotated gene sequences.

Complete and contiguous genome assemblies greatly improve the quality of subsequent systems-wide functional profiling studies and the ability to gain novel biological insights. While a de novo genome assembly of an isolated bacterial strain is in most cases straightforward, more informative data about co-existing bacteria as well as synergistic and antagonistic effects can be obtained from a direct analysis of microbial communities. However, the complexity of metagenomic samples represents a major challenge. While third generation sequencing technologies have been suggested to enable finished metagenome-assembled genomes, to our knowledge, the complete genome assembly of all dominant strains in a microbiome sample has not been demonstrated. Natural whey starter cultures (NWCs) are used in cheese production and represent low-complexity microbiomes. Previous studies of Swiss Gruyère and selected Italian hard cheeses, mostly based on amplicon metagenomics, concurred that three species generally pre-dominate: Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii.

Results

Two NWCs from Swiss Gruyère producers were subjected to whole metagenome shotgun sequencing using the Pacific Biosciences Sequel and Illumina MiSeq platforms. In addition, longer Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION reads had to be generated for one to resolve repeat regions. Thereby, we achieved the complete assembly of all dominant bacterial genomes from these low-complexity NWCs, which was corroborated by a 16S rRNA amplicon survey. Moreover, two distinct L. helveticus strains were successfully co-assembled from the same sample. Besides bacterial chromosomes, we could also assemble several bacterial plasmids and phages and a corresponding prophage. Biologically relevant insights were uncovered by linking the plasmids and phages to their respective host genomes using DNA methylation motifs on the plasmids and by matching prokaryotic CRISPR spacers with the corresponding protospacers on the phages. These results could only be achieved by employing long-read sequencing data able to span intragenomic as well as intergenomic repeats.

Conclusions

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of complete de novo genome assembly of all dominant strains from low-complexity NWCs based on whole metagenomics shotgun sequencing data. This allowed to gain novel biological insights and is a fundamental basis for subsequent systems-wide omics analyses, functional profiling and phenotype to genotype analysis of specific microbial communities.

Long sequencing reads are information-rich: aiding de novo assembly and reference mapping, and consequently have great potential for the study of microbial communities. However, the best approaches for analysis of long-read metagenomic data are unknown. Additionally, rigorous evaluation of bioinformatics tools is hindered by a lack of long-read data from validated samples with known composition.

Findings

We sequenced 2 commercially available mock communities containing 10 microbial species (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards) with Oxford Nanopore GridION and PromethION. Both communities and the 10 individual species isolates were also sequenced with Illumina technology. We generated 14 and 16 gigabase pairs from 2 GridION flowcells and 150 and 153 gigabase pairs from 2 PromethION flowcells for the evenly distributed and log-distributed communities, respectively. Read length N50 ranged between 5.3 and 5.4 kilobase pairs over the 4 sequencing runs. Basecalls and corresponding signal data are made available (4.2 TB in total). Alignment to Illumina-sequenced isolates demonstrated the expected microbial species at anticipated abundances, with the limit of detection for the lowest abundance species below 50 cells (GridION). De novo assembly of metagenomes recovered long contiguous sequences without the need for pre-processing techniques such as binning.

The 34 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that the authors report include those that resolve to clades that have largely evaded cultivation efforts, such as Gracilibacteria (formerly GN02) and Saccharibacteria (formerly TM7) of the recently described Candidate Phyla Radiation (2). Generating new genomic insights into the understudied members of the human oral cavity is of critical importance for a comprehensive understanding of the microbial ecology and functioning of this biome, and we acknowledge the contribution of the authors on this front. However, the redundant occurrence of bacterial single-copy core genes suggests that more than half of the MAGs that Espinoza et al. report are composite genomes that do not meet the recent quality guidelines suggested by the community (3). Composite genomes that aggregate sequences originating from multiple distinct populations can yield misleading insights when treated and reported as single genomes (4).

To briefly demonstrate their composite nature, we refined some of the key Espinoza et al. MAGs through a previously described approach (5) and the data that the authors kindly provided (1). We found that MAG IV.A, MAG IV.B, and MAG III.A described multiple discrete populations with distinct distribution patterns across individuals (Fig. 1). A phylogenomic analysis of refined MAG IV.A genomes resolved to the candidate phylum Absconditabacteria (formerly SR1) and not to Gracilibacteria as reported by Espinoza et al. (Fig. 1D). A pangenomic analysis of the original and refined MAG III.A genomes with other publicly available Saccharibacteria genomes showed a 7-fold increase in the number of single-copy core genes (Fig. 1E). These findings demonstrate the potential implications of composite MAGs in comparative genomics studies where single-copy core genes are commonly used to infer diversity, phylogeny, and taxonomy (6). Composite MAGs can also lead to inaccurate ecological insights through inflated abundance and prevalence estimates. For instance, the original MAG III.A recruited a total of 1,849,593 reads from Espinoza et al. metagenomes; however, the most abundant refined III.A genome (MAG III.A.2, Fig. 1C) recruited only 629,291 reads.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Gut microbiota was recently demonstrated to be altered both in animal models and humans with different neurodevelopmental disorders and/or epilepsy. By investigating gut microbiota in RTT cohorts, a less rich microbial community was identified which was associated with alterations of fecal microbial short-chain fatty acids. These changes were positively correlated with severe clinical outcomes. Indeed, microbial metabolites can play a crucial role both locally and systemically, having dynamic effects on host metabolism and gene expression in many organs.

We find no evidence for cross-selection between antimicrobial classes, or for effect of air travel between sites. However, AMR gene abundance strongly correlates with socio-economic, health and environmental factors, which we use to predict AMR gene abundances in all countries in the world.

The human gut microbiome (GM) plays an important role in human health and diseases. However, while substantial progress has been made in understanding the role of bacterial inhabitants of the gut, much less is known regarding the viral component of the GM. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses attacking specific host bacteria and likely play important roles in shaping the GM. Although metagenomic approaches have led to the discoveries of many new viruses, they remain largely uncultured as their hosts have not been identified, which hampers our understanding of their biological roles. Existing protocols for isolation of viromes generally require relatively high input volumes and are generally more focused on extracting nucleic acids of good quality and purity for down-stream analysis, and less on purifying viruses with infective capacity. In this study, we report the development of an efficient protocol requiring low sample input yielding purified viromes containing phages that are still infective, which also are of sufficient purity for genome sequencing. We validated the method through spiking known phages followed by plaque assays, qPCR, and metagenomic sequencing. The protocol should facilitate the process of culturing novel viruses from the gut as well as large scale studies on gut viromes.

Due to poor recycling and low circular use, millions of tons accumulate annually in terrestrial or marine environments. Today it has become clear that plastic causes adverse effects in all ecosystems and that microplastics are of particular concern to our health. Therefore, recent microbial research has addressed the question of if and to what extent microorganisms can degrade plastics in the environment. This review summarizes current knowledge on microbial plastic degradation. Enzymes available act mainly on the high-molecular-weight polymers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ester-based polyurethane (PUR). Unfortunately, the best PUR- and PET-active enzymes and microorganisms known still have moderate turnover rates. While many reports describing microbial communities degrading chemical additives have been published, no enzymes acting on the high-molecular-weight polymers polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, ether-based polyurethane, and polyethylene are known. Together, these polymers comprise more than 80% of annual plastic production. Thus, further research is needed to significantly increase the diversity of enzymes and microorganisms acting on these polymers.

Shotgun metagenomics provides powerful insights into microbial community biodiversity and function. Yet, inferences from metagenomic studies are often limited by dataset size and complexity and are restricted by the availability and completeness of existing databases. De novo comparative metagenomics enables the comparison of metagenomes based on their total genetic content.

Results

We developed a tool called Libra that performs an all-vs-all comparison of metagenomes for precise clustering based on their k-mer content. Libra uses a scalable Hadoop framework for massive metagenome comparisons, Cosine Similarity for calculating the distance using sequence composition and abundance while normalizing for sequencing depth, and a web-based implementation in iMicrobe (http://imicrobe.us) that uses the CyVerse advanced cyberinfrastructure to promote broad use of the tool by the scientific community.

Conclusions

A comparison of Libra to equivalent tools using both simulated and real metagenomic datasets, ranging from 80 million to 4.2 billion reads, reveals that methods commonly implemented to reduce compute time for large datasets, such as data reduction, read count normalization, and presence/absence distance metrics, greatly diminish the resolution of large-scale comparative analyses. In contrast, Libra uses all of the reads to calculate k-mer abundance in a Hadoop architecture that can scale to any size dataset to enable global-scale analyses and link microbial signatures to biological processes.

The gut microbiota plays important roles in modulating host metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated differences in the gut microbiome of T2D and prediabetic individuals compared to healthy individuals, with distinct disease-related microbial profiles being reported in groups of different age and ethnicity. However, confounding factors such as anti-diabetic medication hamper identification of the gut microbial changes in disease development.

Method

We used a combination of in-depth metagenomics and metaproteomics analyses of faecal samples from treatment-naïve type 2 diabetic (TN-T2D, n = 77), pre-diabetic (Pre-DM, n = 80), and normal glucose tolerant (NGT, n = 97) individuals to investigate compositional and functional changes of the gut microbiota and the faecal content of microbial and host proteins in Pre-DM and treatment-naïve T2D individuals to elucidate possible host-microbial interplays characterizing different disease stages.

Findings

We observed distinct differences characterizing the gut microbiota of these three groups and validated several key features in an independent TN-T2D cohort. We also demonstrated that the content of several human antimicrobial peptides and pancreatic enzymes differed in faecal samples between three groups.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest a complex, disease stage-dependent interplay between the gut microbiota and the host and point to the value of metaproteomics to gain further insight into interplays between the gut microbiota and the host.

Fibromyalgia is a complex, relatively unknown disease characterised by chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain. The gut-brain axis connects the gut microbiome with the brain through the enteric nervous system (ENS); its disruption has been associated with psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. To gain an insight into the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia and identify diagnostic biomarkers, we combined different omics techniques to analyse microbiome and serum composition.

Methods

We collected faeces and blood samples to study the microbiome, the serum metabolome and circulating cytokines and miRNAs from a cohort of 105 fibromyalgia patients and 54 age- and environment-matched healthy individuals. We sequenced the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA gene from faeces samples. UPLC-MS metabolomics and custom multiplex cytokine and miRNA analysis (FirePlex™ technology) were used to examine sera samples. Finally, we combined the different data types to search for potential biomarkers.

Results

We found that the diversity of bacteria is reduced in fibromyalgia patients. The abundance of the Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium genera (bacteria participating in the metabolism of neurotransmitters in the host) in these patients was significantly reduced. The serum metabolome analysis revealed altered levels of glutamate and serine, suggesting changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The combined serum metabolomics and gut microbiome datasets showed a certain degree of correlation, reflecting the effect of the microbiome on metabolic activity. We also examined the microbiome and serum metabolites, cytokines and miRNAs as potential sources of molecular biomarkers of fibromyalgia.

Conclusions

Our results show that the microbiome analysis provides more significant biomarkers than the other techniques employed in the work. Gut microbiome analysis combined with serum metabolomics can shed new light onto the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia. We provide a list of bacteria whose abundance changes in this disease and propose several molecules as potential biomarkers that can be used to evaluate the current diagnostic criteria.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Here we describe the engineering and improvement of a thermostable viral family A polymerase with inherent reverse transcriptase activity for use in RT-PCR. Using the 3173 PyroPhage polymerase, previously identified from hot spring metagenomic sampling, and additional thermostable orthologs as a source of natural diversity, we used gene shuffling for library generation and screened for novel variants that retain high thermostability and display elevated reverse transcriptase activity. We then created a fusion enzyme between a high-performing variant polymerase and the 5′→3′ nuclease domain of Taq DNA polymerase that provided compatibility with probe-based detection chemistries and enabled highly sensitive detection of structured RNA targets.

Here, we combine culture-based population genomics and metagenomics to investigate the within-microbiome evolution of Bacteroides fragilis. We find that intra-individual B. fragilis populations contain substantial de novo nucleotide and mobile element diversity, preserving years of within-person history. This history reveals multiple signatures of within-person adaptation, including parallel evolution in sixteen genes. Many of these genes are implicated in cell-envelope biosynthesis and polysaccharide utilization. Tracking evolutionary trajectories using near-daily metagenomic sampling, we find evidence for years-long coexistence in one subject despite adaptive dynamics. We investigated one adaptive mutation, common in our cohort, in public metagenomes and found that it emerges frequently in Western, but not Chinese microbiomes.

We established quality metrics, threshold values, and limits of detection of 0.2–313 genomic copies or colony forming units per milliliter for each representative organism type. Gross hemolysis and excess host nucleic acid reduced assay sensitivity; however, spiked phages used as internal controls were reliable indicators of sensitivity loss. Diagnostic test accuracy was evaluated by blinded mNGS testing of 95 patient samples, revealing 73% sensitivity and 99% specificity compared to original clinical test results, and 81% positive percent agreement and 99% negative percent agreement after discrepancy analysis. Subsequent mNGS challenge testing of 20 positive CSF samples prospectively collected from a cohort of pediatric patients hospitalized with meningitis, encephalitis, and/or myelitis showed 92% sensitivity and 96% specificity relative to conventional microbiological testing of CSF in identifying the causative pathogen. These results demonstrate the analytic performance of a laboratory-validated mNGS assay for pan-pathogen detection, to be used clinically for diagnosis of neurological infections from CSF.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

The microbial diversity and composition, bacterial co-occurrence correlations and predictive functional profiles were compared across different microhabitats.

Findings: GC-specific stomach microhabitats, not GC stages or types, determine the composition and diversity of the gastric microbiota. Most notably, bacterial richness was decreased in peritumoral and tumoral microhabitats, and the correlation network of abundant gastric bacteria was simplified in tumoral microhabitat. Helicobacter pylori (HP), Prevotella copri and Bacteroides uniformis were significantly decreased, whereas Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus anginosus and Propionibacterium acnes were increased in tumoral microhabitat. Higher HP colonisation influenced the overall structure of the gastric microbiota in normal and peritumoral microhabitats.

Despite improved diagnostics, pulmonary pathogens in immunocompromised children frequently evade detection, leading to significant mortality. Therefore, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay capable of evaluating the pulmonary microbiome and identifying diverse pathogens in the lungs of immunocompromised children.

Methods

We collected 41 lower respiratory specimens from 34 immunocompromised children undergoing evaluation for pulmonary disease at 3 children’s hospitals from 2014–2016. Samples underwent mechanical homogenization, parallel RNA/DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide reference database to determine taxonomic identities. Statistical outliers were determined based on abundance within each sample and relative to other samples in the cohort.

Results

We identified a rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome that contained bacteria, fungi, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses in each patient. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous among samples but could be distinguished as possible causes of disease by parsing for outlier organisms. Samples with bacterial outliers had significantly depressed alpha-diversity (median, 0.61; interquartile range [IQR], 0.33–0.72 vs median, 0.96; IQR, 0.94–0.96; P < .001). Potential pathogens were detected in half of samples previously negative by clinical diagnostics, demonstrating increased sensitivity for missed pulmonary pathogens (P < .001).

Conclusions

An optimized mNGS assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of the lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Potential pathogens can be identified based on absolute and relative abundance. Ongoing investigation is needed to determine the pathogenic significance of outlier microbes in the lungs of immunocompromised children with pulmonary disease.

The importance of the accessory enzymes such as α-L-arabinofuranosidases (AFases) in synergistic interactions within cellulolytic mixtures has introduced a paradigm shift in the search for hydrolytic enzymes. The aim of this study was to characterize novel AFase genes encoding enzymes with differing temperature optima and thermostabilities for use in hydrolytic cocktails.

Results

Three fosmids, pFos-H4, E3 and D3 were selected from the cloned metagenome of high temperature compost, expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified to homogeneity from cell lysate. All the AFases were clustered within the GH51 AFase family and shared a homo-hexameric structure. Both AFase-E3 and H4 showed optimal activity at 60 °C while AFase-D3 had unique properties as it showed optimal activity at 25 °C as well as the ability to maintain substantial activity at temperatures as high as 90 °C. However, AFase-E3 was the most thermostable amongst the three AFases showing full activity even at 70 °C. The maximum activity was observed at a pH profile between pH 4.0–6.0 for all three AFases with optimal activity for AFase H4, D3 and E3 at pH 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0, respectively. All the AFases showed KM range between 0.31 mM and 0.43 mM, Kcat range between 131 s− 1 and 219 s− 1 and the specific activity for AFase-H4, AFases-E3 and was 143, 228 and 175 U/mg, respectively. AFases-E3 and D3 displayed activities against pNP-β-L-arabinopyranoside and pNP-β-L-mannopyranoside respectively, and both hydrolysed pNP-β-D-glucopyranoside.

Conclusion

All three AFases displayed different biochemical characteristics despite all showing conserved overall structural similarity with typical domains of AFases belonging to GH51 family. The hydrolysis of cellobiose by a GH51 family AFase is demonstrated for the first time in this study.

Increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota contributes to the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases. However, little is known about the effects of commonly used antidiabetic agents on the gut microbiota. In this study, we investigated the roles of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and α-glucosidase inhibitor in modulating the gut microbiota.

Methods

16S-rDNA sequencing was performed to analyse the effects of DPP-4i and acarbose on the gut microbiota in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from type 2 diabetes patients to germ-free mice was performed to investigate the contribution of the altered microbiome to antidiabetic effects of the drugs. Fecal metabolomics was also analysed by untargeted and targeted GC–MS systems.

Findings

Although DPP-4i and α-glucosidase inhibitor both altered the gut microbial composition, only the microbiome modulation of DPP-4i contributed to its hypoglycemic effect. Specifically, the changes of 68.6% genera induced by HFD were rescued by DPP-4i. FMT showed that the DPP-4i-altered microbiome improved glucose tolerance in colonized mice, while acarbose did not. Moreover, DPP-4i increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and also promoted a functional shift in the gut microbiome, especially increasing the production of succinate.

Interpretation

Our findings demonstrate an important effect of DPP-4i on the gut microbiota, revealing a new hypoglycemic mechanism and an additional benefit of it. Furthermore, modulating the microbial composition, and the functional shift arising from changes in the microbiome, might be a potential strategy for improving glucose homeostasis.

Mosquitoes are the most important invertebrate viral vectors in humans and harbor a high diversity of understudied viruses, which has been shown in many mosquito virome studies in recent years. These studies generally performed metagenomics sequencing on pools of mosquitoes, without assessment of the viral diversity in individual mosquitoes. To address this issue, we applied our optimized viral metagenomics protocol (NetoVIR) to compare the virome of single and pooled Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected from different locations in Guadeloupe, in 2016 and 2017.

Results

The total read number and viral reads proportion of samples containing a single mosquito have no significant difference compared with those of pools containing five mosquitoes, which proved the feasibility of using single mosquito for viral metagenomics. A comparative analysis of the virome revealed a higher abundance and more diverse eukaryotic virome in Aedes aegypti, whereas Culex quinquefasciatus harbors a richer and more diverse phageome. The majority of the identified eukaryotic viruses were mosquito-species specific. We further characterized the genomes of 11 novel eukaryotic viruses. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses of the six most abundant eukaryotic viruses indicated that the majority of individual mosquitoes were infected by several of the selected viruses with viral genome copies per mosquito ranging from 267 to 1.01 × 108 (median 7.5 × 106) for Ae. aegypti and 192 to 8.69 × 106 (median 4.87 × 104) for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Additionally, in Cx. quinquefasciatus, a number of phage contigs co-occurred with several marker genes of Wolbachia sp. strain wPip.

Conclusions

We firstly demonstrate the feasibility to use single mosquito for viral metagenomics, which can provide much more precise virome profiles of mosquito populations. Interspecific comparisons show striking differences in abundance and diversity between the viromes of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Those two mosquito species seem to have their own relatively stable ""core eukaryotic virome"", which might have important implications for the competence to transmit important medically relevant arboviruses. The presence of Wolbachia in Cx. quinquefasciatus might explain (1) the lower overall viral load compared to Ae. aegypti, (2) the identification of multiple unknown phage contigs, and (3) the difference in competence for important human pathogens. How these viruses, phages, and bacteria influence the physiology and vector competence of mosquito hosts warrants further research.

As noted, the added value of their paper is its contribution to new understanding of the critical changes to gut microbial function that occur before and after pregnancy and during the first year of life, for which there is a paucity of information.

The main finding of the Gosalbes et al. study was that enhanced enzymatic activity found in fecal samples during the last trimester of pregnancy related to carbohydrate utilization by gut microbiota. This was proposed to be a function of the hyperglycemic state and leaky gut of later pregnancy, which made the gut lumen hyperglycemic as well. Equally plausible, could be greater maternal intake of starch and sugars in the last trimester, which would directly enhance substrate availability to microbiota in the gut. As dietary carbohydrate increases in later pregnancy, micronutrient intake declines [2], which begs the question as to whether other factors (e.g., deficiencies or excesses of cofactors such as iron) are key influencers of microbiome metabolism beyond carbohydrate substrate availability.

Understandably, Gosalbes et al. focused their discussion on differences in the gut microbial transcriptome of pregnancy compared to that of the postpartum period since the former constituted the majority of study findings. However, it is worth noting that maternal gut microbiota play an essential role during breastfeeding to produce metabolites, such as amino and short-chain fatty acids, which make their way into breast milk and support the nursing infant [3]. The Gosalbes et al. study included mothers who were breastfeeding. Relative to pregnancy, the gut microbial transcriptome in the postnatal period of study mothers was enriched in functions related to the synthesis of histidine, aromatic amino acids, fatty acids and phospholipids. On the other hand, Jost el al reported that maternal fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids in the postnatal period were maintained at the same levels as those in the last trimester of pregnancy, despite concomitant reductions in fecal streptococci and enterobacteria [4], microbiota which increase in abundance towards the end of pregnancy [5]. This constancy in metabolite production during a period of change in microbial composition and in enzyme activity highlights the plasticity of microbiota in the synthesis of metabolites in response to the physiology of birth and breastfeeding.

In our opinion, the most interesting finding was the upregulation of enzymes in the phosphortrans-butyrylase pathway of butyrate production during the first few months of infant life. As the authors aptly noted, this pathway is prominent in the butyrate-producing microbiota of the Firmicutes phylum, which are normally low in abundance soon after birth [6,7]. Here it is worth pointing out that other microbiota which do not normally produce butyrate have the capacity to switch to this pathway under more aerobic (soon after birth) or acidic (during breastfeeding) conditions [8]. Again, the Gosalbes et al. findings demonstrate the nimbleness of human microbiota under the ever-changing conditions of the infant gut.

As we end our commentary, we wish to turn the reader's attention to some of the technical aspects of this transcriptomics study. Observed changes in enzyme activity of microbiota conceivably reflect gut microbial strategies for survival upon exposure to oxygen or other substances in the air, or to a colder temperature after sampling from the warm, anaerobic environment of the gut [9]. For this reason, some may argue that fecal transcriptomics is not a valid method to monitor changes in the human gut microbiome. But the larger issue, which in epidemiologic terms is known as measurement error or misclassification bias, is whether study findings could be biased by the process for fecal sample collection which generated the RNA transcript data. Differential misclassification bias occurs when the error rate in the collection process differs according to the source and place of the sample collection (e.g., mother - hospital versus infant - home). Simply put, misclassification bias would result if the retrieval and storage of fecal samples led to systematic differences in reported enzyme pathways. This would lead readers to question, for example, whether higher enzyme activity in carbohydrate metabolism of the maternal gut microbiome in the prenatal versus the postnatal period could possibly be due to greater air contamination or drop in temperature of the prenatal samples. The addition of the RNA stabilization agent after fecal samples were frozen (versus the usual practice of adding the stabilizer beforehand) is also an issue of bias but since it affects all samples, the end result would be non-differential misclassification bias which ultimately minimizes group differences.",,Metatranscriptomic,Suraj Patel,

Mosquitoes are the most important invertebrate viral vectors in humans and harbor a high diversity of understudied viruses, which has been shown in many mosquito virome studies in recent years. These studies generally performed metagenomics sequencing on pools of mosquitoes, without assessment of the viral diversity in individual mosquitoes. To address this issue, we applied our optimized viral metagenomics protocol (NetoVIR) to compare the virome of single and pooled Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected from different locations in Guadeloupe, in 2016 and 2017.

Results

The total read number and viral reads proportion of samples containing a single mosquito have no significant difference compared with those of pools containing five mosquitoes, which proved the feasibility of using single mosquito for viral metagenomics. A comparative analysis of the virome revealed a higher abundance and more diverse eukaryotic virome in Aedes aegypti, whereas Culex quinquefasciatus harbors a richer and more diverse phageome. The majority of the identified eukaryotic viruses were mosquito-species specific. We further characterized the genomes of 11 novel eukaryotic viruses. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses of the six most abundant eukaryotic viruses indicated that the majority of individual mosquitoes were infected by several of the selected viruses with viral genome copies per mosquito ranging from 267 to 1.01 × 108 (median 7.5 × 106) for Ae. aegypti and 192 to 8.69 × 106 (median 4.87 × 104) for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Additionally, in Cx. quinquefasciatus, a number of phage contigs co-occurred with several marker genes of Wolbachia sp. strain wPip.

Conclusions

We firstly demonstrate the feasibility to use single mosquito for viral metagenomics, which can provide much more precise virome profiles of mosquito populations. Interspecific comparisons show striking differences in abundance and diversity between the viromes of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Those two mosquito species seem to have their own relatively stable ""core eukaryotic virome"", which might have important implications for the competence to transmit important medically relevant arboviruses. The presence of Wolbachia in Cx. quinquefasciatus might explain (1) the lower overall viral load compared to Ae. aegypti, (2) the identification of multiple unknown phage contigs, and (3) the difference in competence for important human pathogens. How these viruses, phages, and bacteria influence the physiology and vector competence of mosquito hosts warrants further research.

Metagenomic studies carried out in the past decade have led to an enhanced understanding of the gut microbiome in human health; however, the Indian gut microbiome has not been well explored. We analyzed the gut microbiome of 110 healthy individuals from two distinct locations (North-Central and Southern) in India using multi-omics approaches, including 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic profiling of fecal and serum samples.

Results

The gene catalogue established in this study emphasizes the uniqueness of the Indian gut microbiome in comparison to other populations. The gut microbiome of the cohort from North-Central India, which was primarily consuming a plant-based diet, was found to be associated with Prevotella and also showed an enrichment of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, the gut microbiome of the cohort from Southern India, which was consuming an omnivorous diet, showed associations with Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium and had an enrichment of short chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and BCAA transporters. This corroborated well with the metabolomics results, which showed higher concentration of BCAAs in the serum metabolome of the North-Central cohort and an association with Prevotella. In contrast, the concentration of BCAAs was found to be higher in the fecal metabolome of the Southern-India cohort and showed a positive correlation with the higher abundance of BCAA transporters.

Conclusions

The study reveals the unique composition of the Indian gut microbiome, establishes the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue, and compares it with the gut microbiome of other populations. The functional associations revealed using metagenomic and metabolomic approaches provide novel insights on the gut-microbe-metabolic axis, which will be useful for future epidemiological and translational researches.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Diet and antibiotics are known to play crucial roles in changes in the microbiota ecosystem and the disruption of its balance; therefore, the manipulation of gut microbiota may represent an accurate strategy to understand its relationship with obesity caused by diet. Fecal microbiota transplantation, during which fecal microbiota from a healthy donor is transplanted to an obese subject, has aroused interest as an effective approach for the treatment of obesity. To determine its success, a multiomics approach was used that combined metagenomics and metaproteomics to study microbiota composition and function. To do this, a study was performed in rats that evaluated the effect of a hypercaloric diet on the gut microbiota, and this was combined with antibiotic treatment to deplete the microbiota before fecal microbiota transplantation to verify its effects on gut microbiota-host homeostasis. Our results showed that a high-fat diet induces changes in microbiota biodiversity and alters its function in the host. Moreover, we found that antibiotics depleted the microbiota enough to reduce its bacterial content. Finally, we assessed the use of fecal microbiota transplantation as a complementary obesity therapy, and we found that it reversed the effects of antibiotics and reestablished the microbiota balance, which restored normal functioning and alleviated microbiota disruption. This new approach could be implemented to support the dietary and healthy habits recommended as a first option to maintain the homeostasis of the microbiota.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

We applied this assay to 51 urinary cfDNA isolates collected from a cohort of kidney transplant recipients with and without bacterial and viral infection of the urinary tract. We find that the cell and tissue types of origin of urinary cfDNA can be derived from its genome-wide profile of methylation marks, and strongly depend on infection status. We find evidence of kidney and bladder tissue damage due to viral and bacterial infection, respectively, and of the recruitment of neutrophils to the urinary tract during infection. Through direct comparison to conventional metagenomic sequencing as well as clinical tests of infection, we find this assay accurately captures the bacterial and viral composition of the sample. The assay presented here is straightforward to implement, offers a systems view into bacterial and viral infections of the urinary tract, and can find future use as a tool for the differential diagnosis of infection.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Virophages are small viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes that replicate along with giant viruses and co-infect eukaryotic cells. Due to the paucity of virophage reference genomes, a collective understanding of the global virophage diversity, distribution, and evolution is lacking.

Results

Here we screened a public collection of over 14,000 metagenomes using the virophage-specific major capsid protein (MCP) as “bait.” We identified 44,221 assembled virophage sequences, of which 328 represent high-quality (complete or near-complete) genomes from diverse habitats including the human gut, plant rhizosphere, and terrestrial subsurface. Comparative genomic analysis confirmed the presence of four core genes in a conserved block. We used these genes to establish a revised virophage classification including 27 clades with consistent genome length, gene content, and habitat distribution. Moreover, for eight high-quality virophage genomes, we computationally predicted putative eukaryotic virus hosts.

Conclusion

Overall, our approach has increased the number of known virophage genomes by 10-fold and revealed patterns of genome evolution and global virophage distribution.

The dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Heavily glycosylated mucin establishes a first-line barrier against pathogens and serves as a niche for microbial growth.

Methods

To elucidate relationships among dysbiosis, abnormal mucin utilisation, and microbial metabolic dysfunction, we analysed short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and mucin components in stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 44 Crohn's disease (CD) patients from Japan.

Findings

Levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in stools of both CD and UC patients than in stools of healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified seven bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels; the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans serve as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgt+Treg cells and IgA-producing cells in colonic lamina propria. Microbial utilisation of mucin-associated O-glycans was significantly reduced in n-butyrate-deficient UC patients.

Interpretation

Mucin O-glycans facilitate symbiosynthesis of n-butyrate by gut microbiota. Abnormal mucin utilisation may lead to reduced n-butyrate production in UC patients.

Elucidating the ecological and biological identity of extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements (eMGEs), such as plasmids and bacteriophages, in the human gut remains challenging due to their high complexity and diversity.

Results

Here, we show efficient identification of eMGEs as complete circular or linear contigs from PacBio long-read metagenomic data. De novo assembly of PacBio long reads from 12 faecal samples generated 82 eMGE contigs (2.5~666.7-kb), which were classified as 71 plasmids and 11 bacteriophages, including 58 novel plasmids and six bacteriophages, and complete genomes of five diverse crAssphages with terminal direct repeats. In a dataset of 413 gut metagenomes from five countries, many of the identified plasmids were highly abundant and prevalent. The ratio of gut plasmids by our plasmid data is more than twice that in the public database. Plasmids outnumbered bacterial chromosomes three to one on average in this metagenomic dataset. Host prediction suggested that Bacteroidetes-associated plasmids predominated, regardless of microbial abundance. The analysis found several plasmid-enriched functions, such as inorganic ion transport, while antibiotic resistance genes were harboured mostly in low-abundance Proteobacteria-associated plasmids.

Conclusions

Overall, long-read metagenomics provided an efficient approach for unravelling the complete structure of human gut eMGEs, particularly plasmids.

Despite the potential importance of this cofactor for soil microbial communities, the producers and consumers of cobalamin in terrestrial environments are still unknown. Here we provide the first metagenome-based assessment of soil cobalamin-producing bacteria and archaea, quantifying and classifying genes encoding proteins for cobalamin biosynthesis, transport, remodeling, and dependency in 155 soil metagenomes with profile hidden Markov models. We also measured several forms of cobalamin (CN-, Me-, OH-, Ado-B12) and the cobalamin lower ligand (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole; DMB) in 40 diverse soil samples. Metagenomic analysis revealed that less than 10% of soil bacteria and archaea encode the genetic potential for de novo synthesis of this important enzyme cofactor. Predominant soil cobalamin producers were associated with the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, and Thaumarchaeota. In contrast, a much larger proportion of abundant soil genera lacked cobalamin synthesis genes and instead were associated with gene sequences encoding cobalamin transport and cobalamin-dependent enzymes. The enrichment of DMB and corresponding DMB synthesis genes, relative to corrin ring synthesis genes, suggests an important role for cobalamin remodelers in terrestrial habitats. Together, our results indicate that microbial cobalamin production and repair serve as keystone functions that are significantly correlated with microbial community size, diversity, and biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Antibiotic-resistant (AR) bacteria are a global threat. AR bacteria can be acquired in early life and have long-term sequelae. Limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance without triggering the development of additional resistance mechanisms is of immense clinical value. Here, we show how the infant gut microbiome can be modified, resulting in a significant reduction of AR genes (ARGs) and the potentially pathogenic bacteria that harbor them.

Methods

The gut microbiome was characterized using shotgun metagenomics of fecal samples from two groups of healthy, term breastfed infants. One group was fed B. infantis EVC001 in addition to receiving lactation support (n = 29, EVC001-fed), while the other received lactation support alone (n = 31, controls). Coliforms were isolated from fecal samples and genome sequenced, as well as tested for minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics.

Results

Infants fed B. infantis EVC001 exhibited a change to the gut microbiome, resulting in a 90% lower level of ARGs compared to controls. ARGs that differed significantly between groups were predicted to confer resistance to beta lactams, fluoroquinolones, or multiple drug classes, the majority of which belonged to Escherichia, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus. Minimal inhibitory concentration assays confirmed the resistance phenotypes among isolates with these genes. Notably, we found extended-spectrum beta lactamases among healthy, vaginally delivered breastfed infants who had never been exposed to antibiotics.

Conclusions

Colonization of the gut of breastfed infants by a single strain of B. longum subsp. infantis had a profound impact on the fecal metagenome, including a reduction in ARGs. This highlights the importance of developing novel approaches to limit the spread of these genes among clinically relevant bacteria. Future studies are needed to determine whether colonization with B. infantis EVC001 decreases the incidence of AR infections in breastfed infants.

The use of these NGS methods allows for the detection and identification of (‘difficult-to-culture’) microorganisms using a culture-independent strategy. In the field of routine clinical diagnostics however, the application of NGS is currently limited to microbial strain typing for epidemiological purposes only, even though the implementation of NGS for microbial community analysis may yield clinically important information. This lack of NGS implementation is due to many different factors, including issues relating to NGS method standardization and result reproducibility. In this review article, the authors provide a general introduction to the most widely used NGS methods currently available (i.e., targeted amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics) and the strengths and weaknesses of each method is discussed. The focus of the publication then shifts toward 16S rRNA gene NGS methods, which are currently the most cost-effective and widely used NGS methods for research purposes, and are therefore more likely to be successfully implemented into routine clinical diagnostics in the short term. In this respect, the experimental pitfalls and biases created at each step of the 16S rRNA gene NGS workflow are explained, as well as their potential solutions. Finally, a novel diagnostic microbiota profiling platform (‘MYcrobiota’) is introduced, which was developed by the authors by taking into consideration the pitfalls, biases, and solutions explained in this article. The development of the MYcrobiota, and future NGS methodologies, will help pave the way toward the successful implementation of NGS methodologies into routine clinical diagnostics.",,"Metagenomic,16S/ITS Amplicon",Suraj Patel,

Dysbiosis is related to a plethora of diseases, including skin, inflammatory, metabolic, and neurological disorders. A better understanding of the host-microbe interaction is essential for determining the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these ailments. The significance of the microbiome on host health has led to the emergence of new therapeutic approaches focused on the prescribed manipulation of the host microbiome, either by removing harmful taxa or reinstating missing beneficial taxa and the functional roles they perform. Culturing large numbers of microbial taxa in the laboratory is problematic at best, if not impossible. Consequently, this makes it very difficult to comprehensively catalog the individual members comprising a specific microbiome, as well as understanding how microbial communities function and influence host-pathogen interactions.

All subjects had been treated for any dental caries or periodontal disease with all restorative treatment completed at least 1 year ago and had ≤3 residual pockets. They were categorized based on a past diagnosis of chronic periodontitis into “healthy” (H) or “periodontitis” (P) categories. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected, genomic DNA was isolated, and high throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA (V3-V4) gene amplicons was performed. The sequences were assigned taxonomy at the species level by using a BLASTN based algorithm that used a combined reference database of HOMD RefSeqV14.51, HOMD RefSeqExtended V1.1 and GreenGeneGold. Species-level OTUs were subjected to downstream analysis in QIIME and R. For P and H group comparisons, community diversity measures were compared, differentially abundant species were determined using DESeq2, and disease indicator species were determined using multi-level pattern analysis within the R package “indicspecies.”

Results: P subjects were significantly older than H subjects (p = 0.003) but not significantly different in their BOP scores (p = 0.82). No significant differences were noted in alpha diversity measures after adjusting for age, gender, and BOP or in the beta diversity estimates. Four species; Treponema sp. oral taxon 237, TM7 sp.

Calcium-dependent antibiotics are a small family of structurally diverse acidic lipopeptides assembled by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that are known to display various modes of action against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Here we use NRPS adenylation (AD) domain sequencing to guide the identification, recovery and cloning of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster from a soil metagenome. Heterologous expression of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster led to the production of cadasides A (1) and B (2), a sub-family of acidic lipopeptides that is distinct from previously characterized calcium-dependent antibiotics in terms of both overall structure and acidic residue rich peptide core. The cadasides inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens by disrupting cell wall biosynthesis in the presence of high concentrations of calcium. Interestingly, sequencing of AD domains from diverse soils found that sequences predicted to arise from cadaside-like gene clusters are predominantly found in soils containing high levels of calcium carbonate.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

We report cultivation of 2 strains of Antarctic Nanohaloarchaeota and show that they require the haloarchaeon Halorubrum lacusprofundi for growth. By performing growth using enrichments and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we demonstrated successful cultivation of Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeum antarcticus, purification of Ca. Nha. antarcticus away from other species, and growth and verification of Ca. Nha. antarcticus with Hrr. lacusprofundi; these findings are analogous to those required for fulfilling Koch’s postulates. We use fluorescent in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy to assess cell structures and interactions; metagenomics to characterize enrichment taxa, generate metagenome assembled genomes, and interrogate Antarctic communities; and proteomics to assess metabolic pathways and speculate about the roles of certain proteins. Metagenome analysis indicates the presence of a single species, which is endemic to Antarctic hypersaline systems that support the growth of haloarchaea. The presence of unusually large proteins predicted to function in attachment and invasion of hosts plus the absence of key biosynthetic pathways (e.g., lipids) in metagenome assembled genomes of globally distributed Nanohaloarchaeota indicate that all members of the lineage have evolved as symbionts.

Mostly used in a research setting, it is now increasingly being used in the clinical realm as well, notably to support diagnosis of viral infections, thereby calling for quality control and the implementation of ring trials (RT) to benchmark pipelines and ensure comparable results. The Swiss NGS clinical virology community therefore decided to conduct a RT in 2018, in order to benchmark current metagenomic workflows used at Swiss clinical virology laboratories, and thereby contribute to the definition of common best practices. The RT consisted of two parts (increments), in order to disentangle the variability arising from the experimental compared to the bioinformatics parts of the laboratory pipeline. In addition, the RT was also designed to assess the impact of databases compared to bioinformatics algorithms on the final results, by asking participants to perform the bioinformatics analysis with a common database, in addition to using their own in-house database. Five laboratories participated in the RT (seven pipelines were tested). We observed that the algorithms had a stronger impact on the overall performance than the choice of the reference database. Our results also suggest that differences in sample preparation can lead to significant differences in the performance, and that laboratories should aim for at least 5–10 Mio reads per sample and use depth of coverage in addition to other interpretation metrics such as the percent of coverage. Performance was generally lower when increasing the number of viruses per sample. The lessons learned from this pilot study will be useful for the development of larger-scale RTs to serve as regular quality control tests for laboratories performing NGS analyses of viruses in a clinical setting.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides insights on transmission, evolution, and drug resistance and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 102 to 103 genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (P = 4.7 × 10−5). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [CT] values, <30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (CT values, 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus, Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza virus titers, we were able to reconstruct >99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample. While further optimization is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Thus, the lack of internet connectivity in resource-limited or remote locations renders downstream analysis problematic, resulting in a lack of sample identification in the field. Due to this dependency, field samples are generally transported back to the lab for analysis where internet availability for downstream analysis is available. These logistics problems and the time lost in sample characterization and identification, pose a significant problem for field scientists. To address this limitation, we have developed a stand-alone data analysis packet using open source tools developed by the Nanopore community that does not depend on internet availability. Like Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ (ONT) cloud-based What’s In My Pot (WIMP) software, we developed the offline MinION Detection Software (MINDS) based on the Centrifuge classification engine for rapid species identification. Several online bioinformatics applications have been developed surrounding ONT’s framework for analysis of long reads. We have developed and evaluated an offline real time classification application pipeline using open source tools developed by the Nanopore community that does not depend on internet availability. Our application has been tested on ATCC’s 20 strain even mix whole cell (ATCC MSA-2002) sample. Using the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004), we were able to identify all 20 organisms at species level. The analysis was performed in 15 min using a Dell Precision 7720 laptop. Our offline downstream bioinformatics application provides a cost-effective option as well as quick turn-around time when analyzing samples in the field, thus enabling researchers to fully utilize ONT’s MinION portability, ease-of-use, and identification capability in remote locations.

Secondary bacterial infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infections. As bacterial disease can be caused by a disturbance of the host microbiome, we examined the impact of influenza on the upper respiratory tract microbiome in a human challenge study.

Methods

The dynamics and ecology of the throat microbiome were examined following an experimental influenza challenge of 52 previously-healthy adult volunteers with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) by intranasal inoculation; 35 healthy control subjects were not subjected to the viral challenge. Serial oropharyngeal samples were taken over a 30-day period, and the V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences were amplified and sequenced to determine the composition of the microbiome. The carriage of pathogens was also detected.

Results

Of the 52 challenged individuals, 43 developed proven influenza infections, 33 of whom became symptomatic. None of the controls developed influenza, although 22% reported symptoms. The diversity of bacterial communities remained remarkably stable following the acquisition of influenza, with no significant differences over time between individuals with influenza and those in the control group. Influenza infection was not associated with perturbation of the microbiome at the level of phylum or genus. There was no change in colonization rates with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis.

Conclusions

The throat microbiota is resilient to influenza infection, indicating the robustness of the upper-airway microbiome.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

With the establishment of the heart-gut axis concept, accumulating studies suggest that the gut microbiome plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Yet, little evidence has been reported in characterizing the gut microbiota shift in atrial fibrillation.

Methods

We include the result of the global alterations that occur in the intestinal microbiota in a cohort of 50 patients with atrial fibrillation and 50 matched controls based on a strategy of metagenomic and metabolomic analyses.

Results

The alterations include a dramatic elevation in microbial diversity and a specific perturbation of gut microbiota composition. Overgrowth of Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, as well as reduction of Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, Oscillibacter, and Bilophila were detected in patients with atrial fibrillation. A gut microbial function imbalance and correlated metabolic pattern changes were observed with atrial fibrillation in both fecal and serum samples. The differential gut microbiome signatures could be used to identify patients with atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions

Our findings characterize the disordered gut microbiota and microbial metabolite profiles in atrial fibrillation. Further research could determine whether intervention strategies targeting intestinal microbiome composition might be useful to counteract the progression of atrial fibrillation.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

This study describes the minimum natural resistome of pig faeces as the bacteria are under no direct antibiotic selective pressure. The faecal resistome of 257 different genes comprised 56 core and 201 accessory resistance genes. The genes present at the highest relative abundances across all samples were tetW, tetQ, tet44, tet37, tet40, mefA, aadE, ant(9)−1, ermB and cfxA2. This study characterized the baseline resistome, the microbiome composition and the metabolic components described by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in healthy pig faeces, without antibiotic selective pressures. The microbiome hierarchical analysis resulted in a cluster tree with a highly similar pattern to that of the accessory resistome cluster tree. Functional capacity profiling identified genes associated with horizontal gene transfer. We identified a statistically significant positive correlation between the total antibiotic resistome and suggested indicator genes, which agree with using these genes as indicators of the total resistomes. The correlation between total resistome and total microbiome in this study was positive and statistically significant. Therefore, the microbiome composition influenced the resistome composition. This study identified a core and accessory resistome present in a cohort of healthy pigs, in the same conditions without antibiotics. It highlights the presence of antibiotic resistance in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure and the variability between animals even under the same housing, food and living conditions. Antibiotic resistance will remain in the healthy pig gut even when antibiotics are not used. Therefore, the risk of antibiotic resistance transfer from animal faeces to human pathogens or the environment will remain in the absence of antibiotics.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

In the present study, contact-independent and contact-dependent interactions between the four Gardnerella subgroups were investigated in vitro. The cell free supernatants of mono- and co-cultures had no effect on growth rates of the Gardnerella subgroups suggesting that there are no contact-independent interactions (and no contest competition). For contact-dependent interactions, mixed communities of 2, 3, or 4 subgroups were created and the initial (0 h) and final population sizes (48 h) were quantified using subgroup-specific PCR. Compared to the null hypothesis of neutral interactions, most (69.3%) of the mixed communities exhibited competition. Competition reduced the growth rates of subgroups A, B, and C. In contrast, the growth rate of subgroup D increased in the presence of the other subgroups. All subgroups were able to form biofilm alone and in mixed communities. Our study suggests that there is scramble competition among Gardnerella subgroups, which likely contributes to the observed distributions of Gardnerella spp. in vaginal microbiomes and the formation of the multispecies biofilms characteristic of bacterial vaginosis.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Contributor Information. corresponding authorCorresponding author.",BMC Genomics,"Metagenome,metatranscriptome,Microbial infection,Prostate cancer,Pseudouridylation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379980/,,"Background

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignant neoplasm among men in many countries. Since most precancerous and cancerous tissues show signs of inflammation, chronic bacterial prostatitis has been hypothesized to be a possible etiology. However, establishing a causal relationship between microbial inflammation and PCa requires a comprehensive analysis of the prostate microbiome. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiome in prostate tissue of PCa patients and investigate its association with tumour clinical characteristics as well as host expression profiles.

Results

The metagenome and metatranscriptome of tumour and the adjacent benign tissues were assessed in 65 Chinese radical prostatectomy specimens. Escherichia, Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were abundant in both metagenome and metatranscriptome, thus constituting the core of the prostate microbiome. The biodiversity of the microbiomes could not be differentiated between the matched tumour/benign specimens or between the tumour specimens of low and high Gleason Scores. The expression profile of ten Pseudomonas genes was strongly correlated with that of eight host small RNA genes; three of the RNA genes may negatively associate with metastasis. Few viruses could be identified from the prostate microbiomes.

Conclusions

This is the first study of the human prostate microbiome employing an integrated metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approach. In this Chinese cohort, both metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses showed a non-sterile microenvironment in the prostate of PCa patients, but we did not find links between the microbiome and local progression of PCa. However, the correlated expression of Pseudomonas genes and human small RNA genes may provide tantalizing preliminary evidence that Pseudomonas infection may impede metastasis.

These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are recognized as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Despite our understanding of the composition and distribution of ARGs in WWTPs, the genetic location, host, and fate of ARGs remain largely unknown.

Results

In this study, we combined Oxford Nanopore and Illumina metagenomics sequencing to comprehensively uncover the resistome context of influent, activated sludge, and effluent of three WWTPs and simultaneously track the hosts of the ARGs. The results showed that most of the ARGs detected in all compartments of the WWTPs were carried by plasmids. Transposons and integrons also showed higher prevalence on plasmids than on the ARG-carrying chromosome. Notably, integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) carrying five types of ARGs were detected, and they may play an important role in facilitating the transfer of ARGs, particularly for tetracycline and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS). A broad spectrum of ARGs carried by plasmids (29 subtypes) and ICEs (4 subtypes) was persistent across the WWTPs. Host tracking showed a variety of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the effluent, suggesting the high potential for their dissemination into receiving environments. Importantly, phenotype-genotype analysis confirmed the significant role of conjugative plasmids in facilitating the survival and persistence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the WWTPs. At last, the consistency in the quantitative results for major ARGs types revealed by Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms demonstrated the feasibility of Nanopore sequencing for resistome quantification.

Conclusion

Overall, these findings substantially expand our current knowledge of resistome in WWTPs, and help establish a baseline analysis framework to study ARGs in the environment.

These microbes also contribute endotoxins and other pro-inflammatory components. A greater understanding of the microbial constituents in these products is sought in order to potentially link select design aspects or manufacturing processes to avoidable increases in harmful constituents. Previous studies looked primarily at bacterial constituents and had not differentiated between viable vs nonviable organisms, so in this study, we sought to use a dual metatranscriptomic and metagenomic analysis to see if differences exist. Using high-throughput sequencing, we observed that there were differences in taxonomic abundances between the metagenome and metatranscriptome, and in the metatranscriptome, we also observed an abundance of plant virus RNA not previously reported in DNA-only studies. We also found in the product tested, that there were no viable bacteria capable of metabolizing nitrate to nitrite. Therefore, the product tested would not be likely to increase TSNAs during shelf storage.

Vector-borne pathogens are a significant public health concern worldwide. Infections with these pathogens, some of which are emerging, are likely under-recognized due to the lack of widely-available laboratory tests. There is an urgent need for further advancement in diagnostic modalities to detect new and known vector-borne pathogens. We evaluated the utility of metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MGS) as a pathogen agnostic approach for detecting vector-borne pathogens from human blood samples.

Methods

Residual whole blood samples from patients with known infection with Babesia microti, Borrelia hermsii, Plasmodium falciparum, Mansonella perstans, Anaplasma phagocytophilum or Ehrlichia chaffeensis were studied. Samples underwent DNA extraction, removal of human DNA, whole genome amplification, and paired-end library preparation, followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT), Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis (MetaPhlAn2), Genomic Origin Through Taxonomic CHAllenge (GOTTCHA) and Kraken 2.

Results

Eight samples were included in the study (2 samples each for P. falciparum and A. phagocytophilum). An average of 27.5 million read pairs was generated per sample (range, 18.3–38.8 million) prior to removal of human reads. At least one of the analytic tools was able to detect four of six organisms at the genus level, and the organism present in five of eight specimens at the species level. Mansonella and Ehrlichia species were not detected by any of the tools; however, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I amino acid sequence analysis suggested the presence of M. perstans genetic material.

Conclusions

MGS is a promising tool with the potential to evolve as a non-hypothesis driven diagnostic test to detect vector-borne pathogens, including protozoa and helminths.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Twenty of 31 patients (64.5%) tested in Kinshasa, DRC, were EBOV positive by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Despite partial degradation of sample RNA during shipping and handling, mNGS followed by EBOV-specific capture probe enrichment in a U.S. genomics laboratory identified EBOV reads in 22 of 70 samples (31.4%) versus in 21 of 70 (30.0%) EBOV-positive samples by repeat qRT-PCR (overall concordance = 87.1%).

Rapid screening and diagnostic methods for TB are urgently required. Rapid development of metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in recent years showed promising and satisfying application of mNGS in several kinds of infectious diseases. However, research directly evaluating the ability of mNGS in TB infection is still scarce.

Methods: We conducted an adult prospective study in mainland China to evaluate the diagnostic performance of mNGS for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) in multiple forms of direct clinical samples compared with GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), traditional diagnostic methods, and the clinical final diagnosis.

Results: Of 123 patients presenting with suspected active TB infection between June 1, 2017, and May 21, 2018, 105 patients underwent synchronous tuberculous testing with culture, Xpert, and mNGS on direct clinical samples including sputum, cerebrospinal fluids, pus, etc. During follow-up, 45 of 105 participants had clinical final diagnosis of active TB infection, including 13 pulmonary TB cases and 32 extrapulmonary TB cases. Compared to clinical final diagnosis, mNGS produced a sensitivity of 44% for all active TB cases, which was similar to Xpert (42%) but much higher than conventional methods (29%). With only one false-positive result, mNGS had a specificity of 98% in our study. mNGS yielded significantly much higher sensitivity in pre-treatment samples (76%) than post-treatment ones (31%) (P = 0.005), which was also true for Xpert and conventional methods. Combining Xpert and mNGS together, the study identified 27 of 45 active TB cases (60%), including all 13 conventional method-identified cases, and the result reached statistical significance compared to conventional methods (McNemar-test P < 0.001).

Conclusions: mNGS had a similar diagnostic ability of MTB compared with Xpert and showed potential for a variety of clinical samples. Combined mNGS and Xpert showed an overall superior advantage over conventional methods and significantly improved the etiology diagnosis of both MTB and other pathogens. The result that anti-TB treatment significantly reduced diagnostic efficacy of culture, Xpert, and mNGS highlighted the importance of collecting samples before empirical treatment.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Emerging trials suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for ulcerative colitis; however, there is a paucity of data in Crohn disease (CD).

Objective

The objectives of this article are to determine whether single-dose FMT improves clinical and endoscopic outcomes in CD patients and to identify meaningful changes in the microbiome in response to FMT.

Methods

We performed a prospective, open-label, single-center study. Ten CD patients underwent FMT and were evaluated for clinical response (defined as decrease in Harvey-Bradshaw Index score ≥3 at one month post-FMT) and microbiome profile (16S ribosomal RNA sequencing) at one month post-FMT.

Results

Three of 10 patients responded to FMT. Two of 10 patients had significant adverse events requiring escalation of therapy. On microbiome analysis, bacterial communities of responders had increased relative abundance of bacteria commonly found in donor gut microbiota.

Conclusions

Single-dose FMT in this cohort of CD patients showed modest effect and potential for harm.

Some of the metabolic effects of bariatric surgery may be mediated by the gut microbiome.

Objectives

To study the effect of bariatric surgery on changes to gut microbiota composition and bacterial pathways, and their relation to metabolic parameters following bariatric surgery.

Settings

University Hospital, United States and Spain

Methods

Microbial diversity and composition by 16S rRNA sequencing, putative bacterial pathways and targeted circulating metabolites were studied in 26 individuals with severe obesity, with and without type 2 diabetes, before and at 3, 6, and 12 months after either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy.

Results

Bariatric surgery tended to increase alpha diversity, and significantly altered beta diversity, microbiota composition and function up to six months after surgery, but these changes tend to regress to pre-surgery levels by 12 months. Twelve of the 15 bacterial pathways enriched after surgery also regress to pre-surgery levels at 12 months. Network analysis identified groups of bacteria significantly correlated with levels of circulating metabolites over time. There were no differences between study sites, surgery type or diabetes status in terms of microbial diversity and composition at baseline and after surgery.

Conclusions

The association between changes in microbiome with decreased circulating biomarkers of inflammation, increased bile acids and products of choline metabolism and other bacterial pathways suggest that the microbiome partially mediates improvement of metabolism during the first year following bariatric surgery.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

The availability of hundreds of city microbiome profiles allows the development of increasingly accurate predictors of the origin of a sample based on its microbiota composition. Typical microbiome studies involve the analysis of bacterial abundance profiles.

Results

Here we use a transformation of the conventional bacterial strain or gene abundance profiles to functional profiles that account for bacterial metabolism and other cell functionalities. These profiles are used as features for city classification in a machine learning algorithm that allows the extraction of the most relevant features for the classification.

Conclusions

We demonstrate here that the use of functional profiles not only predict accurately the most likely origin of a sample but also to provide an interesting functional point of view of the biogeography of the microbiota. Interestingly, we show how cities can be classified based on the observed profile of antibiotic resistances.

These data are commonly used to identify gene families and pathways that were potentially gained or lost in an environment and which may be involved in microbial adaptation. Despite the widespread interest in these events, there are no established best practices for identifying gene gain and loss in metagenomics data. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) represents several mechanisms of gene gain that are especially of interest in clinical microbiology due to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes in natural communities. Several additional mechanisms of gene gain and loss, including gene duplication, gene loss-of-function events, and de novo gene birth are also important to consider in the context of metagenomes but have been less studied. This review is largely focused on detecting HGT in prokaryotic metagenomes, but methods for detecting these other mechanisms are first discussed. For this article to be self-contained, we provide a general background on HGT and the different possible signatures of this process. Lastly, we discuss how improved assembly of genomes from metagenomes would be the most straight-forward approach for improving the inference of gene gain and loss events. Several recent technological advances could help improve metagenome assemblies: long-read sequencing, determining the physical proximity of contigs, optical mapping of short sequences along chromosomes, and single-cell metagenomics.

Contributor Information. corresponding authorCorresponding author. #Contributed equally.",BMC Microbiome,"School-age children,gut microbiota,Enterotype,Metabolic phenotypes",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6320620/,,"Background

The gut microbiota evolves from birth and is in early life influenced by events such as birth mode, type of infant feeding, and maternal and infant antibiotics use. However, we still have a gap in our understanding of gut microbiota development in older children, and to what extent early events and pre-school lifestyle modulate the composition of the gut microbiota, and how this impinges on whole body metabolic regulation in school-age children.

Results

Taking advantage of the KOALA Birth Cohort Study, a long-term prospective birth cohort in the Netherlands with extensive collection of high-quality host metadata, we applied shotgun metagenomics sequencing and systematically investigated the gut microbiota of children at 6–9 years of age. We demonstrated an overall adult-like gut microbiota in the 281 Dutch school-age children and identified 3 enterotypes dominated by the genera Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium, respectively. Importantly, we found that breastfeeding duration in early life and pre-school dietary lifestyle correlated with the composition and functional competences of the gut microbiota in the children at school age. The correlations between pre-school dietary lifestyle and metabolic phenotypes exhibited a striking enterotype dependency. Thus, an inverse correlation between high dietary fiber consumption and low plasma insulin levels was only observed in individuals with the Bacteroides and Prevotella enterotypes, but not in Bifidobacterium enterotype individuals in whom the gut microbiota displayed overall lower microbial gene richness, alpha-diversity, functional potential for complex carbohydrate fermentation, and butyrate and succinate production. High total fat consumption and elevated plasma free fatty acid levels in the Bifidobacterium enterotype are associated with the co-occurrence of Streptococcus.

Conclusions

Our work highlights the persistent effects of breastfeeding duration and pre-school dietary lifestyle in affecting the gut microbiota in school-age children and reveals distinct compositional and functional potential in children according to enterotypes. The findings underscore enterotype-specific links between the host metabolic phenotypes and dietary patterns, emphasizing the importance of microbiome-based stratification when investigating metabolic responses to diets. Future diet intervention studies are clearly warranted to examine gut microbe-diet-host relationships to promote knowledge-based recommendations in relation to improving metabolic health in children.

Metagenomic sequencing of respiratory microbial communities for pathogen identification in pneumonia may help overcome the limitations of culture-based methods. We examined the feasibility and clinical validity of rapid-turnaround metagenomics with Nanopore™ sequencing of clinical respiratory specimens.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study of mechanically-ventilated patients with pneumonia (nine culture-positive and five culture-negative) and without pneumonia (eight controls). We collected endotracheal aspirates and applied a microbial DNA enrichment method prior to metagenomic sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore MinION device. For reference, we compared Nanopore results against clinical microbiologic cultures and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Results

Human DNA depletion enabled in depth sequencing of microbial communities. In culture-positive cases, Nanopore revealed communities with high abundance of the bacterial or fungal species isolated by cultures. In four cases with resistant clinical isolates, Nanopore detected antibiotic resistance genes corresponding to the phenotypic resistance in antibiograms. In culture-negative pneumonia, Nanopore revealed probable bacterial pathogens in 1/5 cases and Candida colonization in 3/5 cases. In controls, Nanopore showed high abundance of oral bacteria in 5/8 subjects, and identified colonizing respiratory pathogens in other subjects. Nanopore and 16S sequencing showed excellent concordance for the most abundant bacterial taxa.

Conclusions

We demonstrated technical feasibility and proof-of-concept clinical validity of Nanopore metagenomics for severe pneumonia diagnosis, with striking concordance with positive microbiologic cultures, and clinically actionable information obtained from sequencing in culture-negative samples. Prospective studies with real-time metagenomics are warranted to examine the impact on antimicrobial decision-making and clinical outcomes.

Worldwide, the number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is increasing, highlighting the importance of global disease pathogen surveillance. Traditional population-based methods may fail to capture important events, particularly in settings with limited access to health care, such as urban informal settlements. In such environments, a mixture of surface water runoff and human feces containing pathogenic microorganisms could be used as a surveillance surrogate.

Method

We conducted a temporal metagenomic analysis of urban sewage from Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, to detect and quantify bacterial and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, viral and parasitic pathogens. Data were examined in conjunction with data from ongoing clinical infectious disease surveillance.

Results

A large variation of read abundances related to bacteria, viruses, and parasites of medical importance, as well as bacterial associated antimicrobial resistance genes over time were detected. Significant increased abundances were observed for a number of bacterial pathogens coinciding with higher abundances of AMR genes. Vibrio cholerae as well as rotavirus A, among other virus peaked in several weeks during the study period whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, varied more over time.

Conclusion

The metagenomic surveillance approach for monitoring circulating pathogens in sewage was able to detect putative pathogen and resistance loads in an urban informal settlement. Thus, valuable if generated in real time to serve as a comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system with the potential to guide disease prevention and treatment. The approach may lead to a paradigm shift in conducting real-time global genomics-based surveillance in settings with limited access to health care.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

However, to date only six cultured giant virus genomes are available from the pelagic ocean. We used at-sea flow cytometry with staining and sorting designed to target wild predatory eukaryotes, followed by DNA sequencing and assembly, to recover novel giant viruses from the Pacific Ocean. We retrieved four ‘PacV’ partial genomes that range from 421 to 1605 Kb, with 13 contigs on average, including the largest marine viral genomic assembly reported to date. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that three of the new viruses span a clade with deep-branching members of giant Mimiviridae, incorporating the Cafeteria roenbergensis virus, the uncultivated terrestrial Faunusvirus, one PacV from a choanoflagellate and two PacV with unclear hosts. The fourth virus, oPacV-421, is phylogenetically related to viruses that infect haptophyte algae. About half the predicted proteins in each PacV have no matches in NCBI nr (e-value < 10−5), totalling 1735 previously unknown proteins; the closest affiliations of the other proteins were evenly distributed across eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses of eukaryotes. The PacVs encode many translational proteins and two encode eukaryotic-like proteins from the Rh family of the ammonium transporter superfamily, likely influencing the uptake of nitrogen during infection. cPacV-1605 encodes a microbial viral rhodopsin (VirR) and the biosynthesis pathway for the required chromophore, the second finding of a choanoflagellate-associated virus that encodes these genes. In co-collected metatranscriptomes, 85% of cPacV-1605 genes were expressed, with capsids, heat shock proteins and proteases among the most highly expressed. Based on orthologue presence–absence patterns across the PacVs and other eukaryotic viruses, we posit the observed viral groupings are connected to host lifestyles as heterotrophs or phototrophs.

Viruses are important components of microbial communities modulating community structure and function; however, only a couple of tools are currently available for phage identification and analysis from metagenomic sequencing data. Here we employed the random forest algorithm to develop VirMiner, a web-based phage contig prediction tool especially sensitive for high-abundances phage contigs, trained and validated by paired metagenomic and phagenomic sequencing data from the human gut flora.

Results

VirMiner achieved 41.06% ± 17.51% sensitivity and 81.91% ± 4.04% specificity in the prediction of phage contigs. In particular, for the high-abundance phage contigs, VirMiner outperformed other tools (VirFinder and VirSorter) with much higher sensitivity (65.23% ± 16.94%) than VirFinder (34.63% ± 17.96%) and VirSorter (18.75% ± 15.23%) at almost the same specificity. Moreover, VirMiner provides the most comprehensive phage analysis pipeline which is comprised of metagenomic raw reads processing, functional annotation, phage contig identification, and phage-host relationship prediction (CRISPR-spacer recognition) and supports two-group comparison when the input (metagenomic sequence data) includes different conditions (e.g., case and control). Application of VirMiner to an independent cohort of human gut metagenomes obtained from individuals treated with antibiotics revealed that 122 KEGG orthology and 118 Pfam groups had significantly differential abundance in the pre-treatment samples compared to samples at the end of antibiotic administration, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), multidrug resistance, and protein transport. The VirMiner webserver is available at http://sbb.hku.hk/VirMiner/.

Conclusions

We developed a comprehensive tool for phage prediction and analysis for metagenomic samples. Compared to VirSorter and VirFinder—the most widely used tools—VirMiner is able to capture more high-abundance phage contigs which could play key roles in infecting bacteria and modulating microbial community dynamics.

Bacteria within family S24-7 (phylum Bacteroidetes) are dominant in the mouse gut microbiota and detected in the intestine of other animals. Because they had not been cultured until recently and the family classification is still ambiguous, interaction with their host was difficult to study and confusion still exists regarding sequence data annotation.

Methods

We investigated family S24-7 by combining data from large-scale 16S rRNA gene analysis and from functional and taxonomic studies of metagenomic and cultured species.

Results

A total of 685 species was inferred by full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence clustering. While many species could not be assigned ecological habitats (93,045 samples analyzed), the mouse was the most commonly identified host (average of 20% relative abundance and nine co-occurring species). Shotgun metagenomics allowed reconstruction of 59 molecular species, of which 34 were representative of the 16S rRNA gene-derived species clusters. In addition, cultivation efforts allowed isolating five strains representing three species, including two novel taxa. Genome analysis revealed that S24-7 spp. are functionally distinct from neighboring families and versatile with respect to complex carbohydrate degradation.

Conclusions

We provide novel data on the diversity, ecology, and description of bacterial family S24-7, for which the name Muribaculaceae is proposed.

Shotgun metagenome data sets of microbial communities are highly diverse, not only due to the natural variation of the underlying biological systems, but also due to differences in laboratory protocols, replicate numbers, and sequencing technologies. Accordingly, to effectively assess the performance of metagenomic analysis software, a wide range of benchmark data sets are required.

Results

We describe the CAMISIM microbial community and metagenome simulator. The software can model different microbial abundance profiles, multi-sample time series, and differential abundance studies, includes real and simulated strain-level diversity, and generates second- and third-generation sequencing data from taxonomic profiles or de novo. Gold standards are created for sequence assembly, genome binning, taxonomic binning, and taxonomic profiling. CAMSIM generated the benchmark data sets of the first CAMI challenge. For two simulated multi-sample data sets of the human and mouse gut microbiomes, we observed high functional congruence to the real data. As further applications, we investigated the effect of varying evolutionary genome divergence, sequencing depth, and read error profiles on two popular metagenome assemblers, MEGAHIT, and metaSPAdes, on several thousand small data sets generated with CAMISIM.

Conclusions

CAMISIM can simulate a wide variety of microbial communities and metagenome data sets together with standards of truth for method evaluation. All data sets and the software are freely available at https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM

(2019) describe the largest whole-genome resequencing dataset published to date for rapeseed (Brassica napus), an allopolyploid crop species that originated just a few thousand years ago under anthropogenic influence and rapidly evolved into one of the world's most important oilseed crops. In almost 1000 accessions spanning species-wide germplasm for oilseed rape, a comprehensive analysis of sequence diversity related to flowering-related traits uncovered selective sweeps associated with eco-geographic adaptation and human selection, attributable particularly to divergence among homoeologs of key flowering-time regulation and ethylene synthesis/signaling genes. The authors further extend their analysis to retrospective, genome-based documentation of diversity footprints that trace the global expansion of the species across a century of breeding. The study contributes not only a rich catalog of genome-wide diversity for genetic analysis and future breeding of important agro-economic traits but also a unique conceptional framework for ongoing selective adaptation of oilseed rape crops to emerging challenges presented by changing climatic conditions in key production areas. Selective sweeps were found to contain genes involved in stress adaptation and development, especially flowering time, indicating that climatic adaptation both in terms of local stress factors and of life-cycle adaptation was the major factor underlying agronomic selection for improved seed yield.
Modulation of flowering behavior and morphotype evolution via post-polyploidization genome restructuring and homoeologous expression changes has previously been identified as a decisive factor in the success of B. napus as a diverse, globally adapted crop (Samans et al., 2017, Schiessl et al., 2017). This new study expands that knowledge by combining information on genome-wide SNP diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression data. The resulting picture underlines the pivotal role of mutations creating novel flowering and stress response phenotypes as a driver of geographic expansion. Moreover, the data show that this selection in B. napus was very specific to distinct gene copies and did not act in parallel on copies of the same gene. Interestingly, functional variation apparently not only arose by mutations within coding sequences but rather via mutations in promoter regions. The two most prominent flowering-time genes, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), were strong candidates for selection. Indeed, the expression patterns of B. napus FT and FLC homoeologs vary in expression between different ecotypes (Figure 1), indicating that promoter variation in floral regulatory genes is an essential factor in the creation of adaptive variation and needs to be considered in knowledge-based breeding approaches. The phenomenon of promoter-driven adaptation may also hold true for other closely related crops: For example, selection against premature bolting in spring-type Brassica rapa ecotypes was shown to be highly associated with promoter variation in a copy of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3) (Su et al., 2018). Interestingly, similar effects are observed in cereals, where mutations in promoter sequences of the cereal gene VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) also associate with eco-geographic adaptation (Deng et al., 2015). Moreover, potential variation in promoter sequences was recently postulated as a possible driver of pleiotropic effects that appear to simultaneously modulate flowering responses and root architecture in wheat and barley (Voss-Fels et al., 2018). Such findings underline the importance of detailed knowledge about the genetic intricacies of flowering-time regulation and abiotic stress responses at the DNA sequence and regulatory expression levels. To provide the knowledge needed for targeted breeding of climate-adapted crops to cope with future challenges, we urgently need more and better resources for illuminating genome-wide and genome-deep data.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

A critical window in infancy has been proposed, during which the microbiota may affect subsequent health. The longitudinal development of the oropharyngeal microbiota is under-studied and may be associated with early-life wheeze. We aimed to investigate the temporal association of the development of the oropharyngeal microbiota with early-life wheeze.

Methods

A population-based birth cohort based in London, UK was followed for 24 months. We collected oropharyngeal swabs at six time-points. Microbiota was determined using sequencing of the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA-encoding gene. Medical records were reviewed for the outcome of doctor diagnosed wheeze. We used a time-varying model to investigate the temporal association between the development of microbiota and doctor-diagnosed wheeze.

Findings

159 participants completed the study to 24 months and for 98 there was complete sequencing data at all timepoints and outcome data. Of these, 26 had doctor-diagnosed wheeze. We observed significant increase in the abundance of Neisseria between 9 and 24 months in children who developed wheeze (p = 0∙003), while in those without wheezing there was a significant increment in the abundance of Granulicatella (p = 0∙012) between 9 and 12 months, and of Prevotella (p = 0∙018) after 18 months.

Interpretation

A temporal association between the respiratory commensal Granulicatella and also Prevotella with wheeze (negative), and between Neisseria and wheeze (positive) was identified in infants prior to one year of age. This adds to evidence for the proposed role of the microbiota in the development of wheeze.

Through an analysis of metabolic pathways in 64 metagenome‐assembled genomes (MAGs), we show that MAG transcript abundance can be tied to differences in metabolic pathways and to potential metabolic interactions between microbial populations, allowing for niche‐partitioning and divergence in both population distribution and activity. Our results illustrate that most microbial populations have a restricted distribution within the seafloor, and that the activity of those microbial populations is tied to both genome content and abiotic factors.",,"Metagenomic,Metatranscriptomic",Suraj Patel,

Adapting this technology for field-forward applications necessitated innovation to minimize size, weight, and power requirements. Rugged, portable instruments, efficient power sources, freeze-dried reagents, data communications, and standard operating procedures for minimally trained users are some examples of limitations that have been overcome to allow qPCR-based data to be generated at the point of need. Despite the high specificity and sensitivity of qPCR, the assays require a priori sequence-based knowledge of the etiological agent to design and produce specific targeted assays with primers and probes. However, in many cases the etiological agent may not be known and pathogen identification must rely on the use of an untargeted screening method. By extracting, preparing, and sequencing all of the genomic material in a particular sample at once, known as metagenomics, a less biased view of the biological entities in that sample can be ascertained. Using metagenomics methods in the field requires the development and optimization of straightforward sample preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics workflows reminiscent of the challenges faced during the development of field-forward qPCR 15 years ago.

Coastal saltmarsh sediments represent an important source of natural methane emissions, much of which originates from quaternary and methylated amines, such as choline and trimethylamine. In this study, we combine DNA stable isotope probing with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 13C2-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by metagenome data assembly, to identify the key microbes responsible for methanogenesis from choline. Microcosm incubation with 13C2-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identifies Deltaproteobacteria of the genera Pelobacter as the major choline utilizers. Methanogenic Archaea of the genera Methanococcoides become enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of metagenomic DNA results in the identification of bins classified as Pelobacter and Methanococcoides. Analyses of these bins reveal that Pelobacter have the genetic potential to degrade choline to trimethylamine using the choline-trimethylamine lyase pathway, whereas Methanococcoides are capable of methanogenesis using the pyrrolysine-containing trimethylamine methyltransferase pathway. Together, our data provide a new insight on the diversity of choline utilizing organisms in coastal sediments and support a syntrophic relationship between Bacteria and Archaea as the dominant route for methanogenesis from choline in this environment.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

A majority of virus families with members that infect fungi have counterparts that infect plants, and in some cases the phylogenetic analyses of these virus families indicate transmission between the plant and fungal kingdoms.

Among the 23 major taxa detected, Anaerolineaceae, Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria exhibited an increased abundance level. RGS2 increased some bacteria reported to be beneficial including Acidobacteria, Bacillus, and Planctomyces (by 42%, 64%, and 1% respectively). Furthermore, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fungal regions revealed significant diversity among the different treatments, with taxa such as Chaetomium (56.2%), Acremonium (4.3%), Fusarium (4%), Aspergillus (3.4%), Sordariomycetes (3%), and Plectosphaerellaceae (2%) showing much abundance. Interestingly, Coprinellus (14%) was observed only in RGS-amended soil. RGS treatments effectively altered soil fungal community structures and reduced certain known pathogenic fungal genera, i.e., Fusarium and Acremonium. The results of the present study suggest that RGS amendment potentially affects the microbial community structures that probably affect the physiological and morphological attributes of eggplant under a plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation system (PGVC) in monoculture.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Although the high-throughput sequencing technique is useful for evaluating gastric microbiome, it is difficult to use clinically. We aimed to develop a predictive model for gastric microbiome based on serologic testing.

Methods

This study was designed to analyze sequencing data obtained from the Hanyang University Gastric Microbiome Cohort, which was established initially to investigate gastric microbial composition according to the intragastric environment. We evaluated the relationship between the relative abundance of potential gastric cancer-associated bacteria (nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria or type IV secretion system [T4SS] protein gene-contributing bacteria) and serologic markers (IgG anti-Helicobacter pylori [HP] antibody or pepsinogen [PG] levels).

Results

We included 57 and 26 participants without and with HP infection, respectively. The relative abundance of nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria was 4.9% and 3.6% in the HP-negative and HP-positive groups, respectively, while that of T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria was 20.5% and 6.5% in the HP-negative and HP-positive groups, respectively. The relative abundance of both nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria increased exponentially as PG levels decreased. Advanced age (only for nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria), a negative result of IgG anti-HP antibody, low PG levels, and high Charlson comorbidity index were associated with a high relative abundance of nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) was 53.7% and 70.0% in the model for nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria, respectively.

Conclusion

Not only the negative results of IgG anti-HP antibody but also low PG levels were associated with a high abundance of nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

The interplay between hosts and their associated microbiome is now recognized as a fundamental basis of the ecology, evolution, and development of both players. These interdependencies inspired a new view of multicellular organisms as “metaorganisms.” The goal of the Collaborative Research Center “Origin and Function of Metaorganisms” is to understand why and how microbial communities form long-term associations with hosts from diverse taxonomic groups, ranging from sponges to humans in addition to plants.

Methods

In order to optimize the choice of analysis procedures, which may differ according to the host organism and question at hand, we systematically compared the two main technical approaches for profiling microbial communities, 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic shotgun sequencing across our panel of ten host taxa. This includes two commonly used 16S rRNA gene regions and two amplification procedures, thus totaling five different microbial profiles per host sample.

Conclusion

While 16S rRNA gene-based analyses are subject to much skepticism, we demonstrate that many aspects of bacterial community characterization are consistent across methods. The resulting insight facilitates the selection of appropriate methods across a wide range of host taxa. Overall, we recommend single- over multi-step amplification procedures, and although exceptions and trade-offs exist, the V3 V4 over the V1 V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Finally, by contrasting taxonomic and functional profiles and performing phylogenetic analysis, we provide important and novel insight into broad evolutionary patterns among metaorganisms, whereby the transition of animals from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat marks a major event in the evolution of host-associated microbial composition.

Recent work suggests that, for any given microbe detected by mNGS, an inverse linear relationship between microbial sequencing reads and sample mass implicates that microbe as a contaminant. By associating sequencing read output with the mass of a spike-in control, we demonstrate that contaminant nucleic acid can be quantified in order to identify the mass contributions of each constituent. In an experiment using a high-resolution (n = 96) dilution series of HeLa RNA spanning 3-logs of RNA mass input, we identified a complex set of contaminants totaling 9.1 ± 2.0 attograms. Given the competition between contamination and the true microbiome in ultra-low biomass samples such as respiratory fluid, quantification of the contamination within a given batch of biological samples can be used to determine a minimum mass input below which sequencing results may be distorted. Rather than completely censoring contaminant taxa from downstream analyses, we propose here a statistical approach that allows separation of the true microbial components from the actual contribution due to contamination. We demonstrate this approach using a batch of n = 97 human serum samples and note that despite E. coli contamination throughout the dataset, we are able to identify a patient sample with significantly more E. coli than expected from contamination alone.

Methods: We conducted an adult prospective study in mainland China to evaluate the diagnostic performance of mNGS for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) in multiple forms of direct clinical samples compared with GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), traditional diagnostic methods, and the clinical final diagnosis.

Results: Of 123 patients presenting with suspected active TB infection between June 1, 2017, and May 21, 2018, 105 patients underwent synchronous tuberculous testing with culture, Xpert, and mNGS on direct clinical samples including sputum, cerebrospinal fluids, pus, etc. During follow-up, 45 of 105 participants had clinical final diagnosis of active TB infection, including 13 pulmonary TB cases and 32 extrapulmonary TB cases.

With only one false-positive result, mNGS had a specificity of 98% in our study. mNGS yielded significantly much higher sensitivity in pre-treatment samples (76%) than post-treatment ones (31%) (P = 0.005), which was also true for Xpert and conventional methods. Combining Xpert and mNGS together, the study identified 27 of 45 active TB cases (60%), including all 13 conventional method-identified cases, and the result reached statistical significance compared to conventional methods (McNemar-test P < 0.001).

Conclusions: mNGS had a similar diagnostic ability of MTB compared with Xpert and showed potential for a variety of clinical samples. Combined mNGS and Xpert showed an overall superior advantage over conventional methods and significantly improved the etiology diagnosis of both MTB and other pathogens. The result that anti-TB treatment significantly reduced diagnostic efficacy of culture, Xpert, and mNGS highlighted the importance of collecting samples before empirical treatment.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is now the leading cause of death from infectious disease, killing people even more than HIV and malaria worldwide (World Health Organization, 2017). An important reason for TB leading to so many deaths is the difficulty of diagnosis, with 40% of estimated incident cases failing to be identified and reported (World Health Organization, 2017). The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (hereinafter referred to as “Xpert”) was endorsed by the World Health Organization in 2010. However, it has not improved global case detection rates and showed limited efficacy in extrapulmonary TB (World Health Organization, 2013). As rapid and accurate diagnosis of TB is a prerequisite for effective treatment, alternative rapid screening and diagnostic methods are urgently required.

Recent years have witnessed rapid development of metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS), featured with the advantage of shortened turnaround time, unbiased detection, and semi-quantitative value in follow-up. To date, several studies have addressed the value of mNGS in finding out the causative pathogens and guiding targeted antimicrobial therapy more quickly (Wilson et al., 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018; Guan et al., 2016; Kawada et al., 2016; Wüthrich et al., 2016; Wylie et al., 2016; Chiu et al., 2017; Murkey et al., 2017; Piantadosi et al., 2017), and a myriad of intense researches have reported their satisfying application of mNGS in several kinds of infectious diseases including central nervous system infection (Wilson et al., 2014, 2018; Brown et al., 2018), prosthetic joint infection (Simner et al., 2018), bloodstream infection (Long et al., 2016; Gosiewski et al., 2017), respiratory tract infection (Langelier et al., 2018), etc. However, research directly evaluating the ability of mNGS in pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB is still scarce; most previous studies have only focused on clinical cases. Therefore, we conducted a single-center prospective study in mainland China to analyze the diagnostic performance of mNGS for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) in multiple forms of direct clinical samples in adults compared with Xpert, conventional diagnostic methods including culture and biopsy, and the clinical final diagnosis.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Metagenomics is the study of genetic materials directly sampled from natural habitats. It has the potential to reveal previously hidden diversity of microscopic life largely due to the existence of highly parallel and low-cost next-generation sequencing technology. Conventional approaches align metagenomic reads onto known reference genomes to identify microbes in the sample. Since such a collection of reference genomes is very large, the approach often needs high-end computing machines with large memory which is not often available to researchers. Alternative approaches follow an alignment-free methodology where the presence of a microbe is predicted using the information about the unique k-mers present in the microbial genomes. However, such approaches suffer from high false positives due to trading off the value of k with the computational resources. In this article, we propose a highly efficient metagenomic sequence classification (MSC) algorithm that is a hybrid of both approaches. Instead of aligning reads to the full genomes, MSC aligns reads onto a set of carefully chosen, shorter and highly discriminating model sequences built from the unique k-mers of each of the reference sequences.

Results

Microbiome researchers are generally interested in two objectives of a taxonomic classifier: (i) to detect prevalence, i.e. the taxa present in a sample, and (ii) to estimate their relative abundances. MSC is primarily designed to detect prevalence and experimental results show that MSC is indeed a more effective and efficient algorithm compared to the other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, memory and runtime. Moreover, MSC outputs an approximate estimate of the abundances.

In ruminants, early rumen development is vital for efficient fermentation that converts plant materials to human edible food such as milk and meat. Here, we investigate the extent and functional basis of host-microbial interactions regulating rumen development during the first 6 weeks of life.

Results

The use of microbial metagenomics, together with quantification of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and qPCR, reveals the colonization of an active bacterial community in the rumen at birth. Colonization of active complex carbohydrate fermenters and archaea with methyl-coenzyme M reductase activity was also observed from the first week of life in the absence of a solid diet. Integrating microbial metagenomics and host transcriptomics reveals only 26.3% of mRNA transcripts, and 46.4% of miRNAs were responsive to VFAs, while others were ontogenic. Among these, one host gene module was positively associated with VFAs, while two other host gene modules and one miRNA module were negatively associated with VFAs. Eight host genes and five miRNAs involved in zinc ion binding-related transcriptional regulation were associated with a rumen bacterial cluster consisting of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus.

Conclusion

This three-way interaction suggests a potential role of bacteria-driven transcriptional regulation in early rumen development via miRNAs. Our results reveal a highly active early microbiome that regulates rumen development of neonatal calves at the cellular level, and miRNAs may coordinate these host-microbial interactions.

Metagenomic sequencing of respiratory microbial communities for pathogen identification in pneumonia may help overcome the limitations of culture-based methods. We examined the feasibility and clinical validity of rapid-turnaround metagenomics with Nanopore™ sequencing of clinical respiratory specimens.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study of mechanically-ventilated patients with pneumonia (nine culture-positive and five culture-negative) and without pneumonia (eight controls). We collected endotracheal aspirates and applied a microbial DNA enrichment method prior to metagenomic sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore MinION device. For reference, we compared Nanopore results against clinical microbiologic cultures and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Results

Human DNA depletion enabled in depth sequencing of microbial communities. In culture-positive cases, Nanopore revealed communities with high abundance of the bacterial or fungal species isolated by cultures. In four cases with resistant clinical isolates, Nanopore detected antibiotic resistance genes corresponding to the phenotypic resistance in antibiograms. In culture-negative pneumonia, Nanopore revealed probable bacterial pathogens in 1/5 cases and Candida colonization in 3/5 cases. In controls, Nanopore showed high abundance of oral bacteria in 5/8 subjects, and identified colonizing respiratory pathogens in other subjects. Nanopore and 16S sequencing showed excellent concordance for the most abundant bacterial taxa.

Conclusions

We demonstrated technical feasibility and proof-of-concept clinical validity of Nanopore metagenomics for severe pneumonia diagnosis, with striking concordance with positive microbiologic cultures, and clinically actionable information obtained from sequencing in culture-negative samples.

Some of the metabolic effects of bariatric surgery may be mediated by the gut microbiome.

Objectives

To study the effect of bariatric surgery on changes to gut microbiota composition and bacterial pathways, and their relation to metabolic parameters following bariatric surgery.

Settings

University Hospital, United States and Spain

Methods

Microbial diversity and composition by 16S rRNA sequencing, putative bacterial pathways and targeted circulating metabolites were studied in 26 individuals with severe obesity, with and without type 2 diabetes, before and at 3, 6, and 12 months after either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy.

Results

Bariatric surgery tended to increase alpha diversity, and significantly altered beta diversity, microbiota composition and function up to six months after surgery, but these changes tend to regress to pre-surgery levels by 12 months. Twelve of the 15 bacterial pathways enriched after surgery also regress to pre-surgery levels at 12 months. Network analysis identified groups of bacteria significantly correlated with levels of circulating metabolites over time. There were no differences between study sites, surgery type or diabetes status in terms of microbial diversity and composition at baseline and after surgery.

Conclusions

The association between changes in microbiome with decreased circulating biomarkers of inflammation, increased bile acids and products of choline metabolism and other bacterial pathways suggest that the microbiome partially mediates improvement of metabolism during the first year following bariatric surgery.",,16S/ITS Amplicon,Suraj Patel,

In this study, the rumen microbiome from Holstein cows was characterized through a combination of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Methane production (CH4) and dry matter intake (DMI) were individually measured over 4–6 weeks to calculate the CH4 yield (CH4y = CH4/DMI) per cow. We implemented a combination of clustering, multivariate and mixed model analyses to identify a set of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) jointly associated with CH4y and the structure of ruminal microbial communities. Three ruminotype clusters (R1, R2 and R3) were identified, and R2 was associated with higher CH4y. The taxonomic composition on R2 had lower abundance of Succinivibrionaceae and Methanosphaera, and higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Metagenomic data confirmed the lower abundance of Succinivibrionaceae and Methanosphaera in R2 and identified genera (Fibrobacter and unclassified Bacteroidales) not highlighted by metataxonomic analysis. In addition, the functional metagenomic analysis revealed that samples classified in cluster R2 were overrepresented by genes coding for KEGG modules associated with methanogenesis, including a significant relative abundance of the methyl‐coenzyme M reductase enzyme. Based on the cluster assignment, we applied a sparse partial least‐squares discriminant analysis at the taxonomic and functional levels. In addition, we implemented a sPLS regression model using the phenotypic variation of CH4y. By combining these two approaches, we identified 86 discriminant bacterial OTUs, notably including families linked to CH4 emission such as Succinivibrionaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae. These selected OTUs explained 24% of the CH4y phenotypic variance, whereas the host genome contribution was ~14%. In summary, we identified rumen microbial biomarkers associated with the methane production of dairy cows; these biomarkers could be used for targeted methane‐reduction selection programmes in the dairy cattle industry provided they are heritable.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

To date, the capacity to oxidize methane is restricted to microorganisms from three bacterial and one archaeal phyla. Most of our knowledge of methanotrophic metabolism has been obtained using highly enriched or pure cultures grown in the laboratory. However, many methanotrophs currently evade cultivation, thus metagenomics provides a complementary approach for gaining insight into currently unisolated microorganisms. Here we synthesize the studies using metagenomics to glean information about methanotrophs. We complement this summary with an analysis of methanotroph marker genes from 235 publically available metagenomic datasets. We analyze the phylogenetic and environmental distribution of methanotrophs sampled by metagenomics. We also highlight metabolic insights that methanotroph genomes assembled from metagenomes are illuminating. In summary, metagenomics has increased methanotrophic foliage within the tree of life, as well as provided new insights into methanotroph metabolism, which collectively can guide new cultivation efforts. Lastly, given the importance of methanotrophs for biotechnological applications and their capacity to filter greenhouse gases from a variety of ecosystems, metagenomics will continue to be an important component in the arsenal of tools needed for understanding methanotroph diversity and metabolism in both engineered and natural systems.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

Here we establish a ~12-fold expanded global ocean DNA virome dataset of 195,728 viral populations, now including the Arctic Ocean, and validate that these populations form discrete genotypic clusters. Meta-community analyses revealed five ecological zones throughout the global ocean, including two distinct Arctic regions. Across the zones, local and global patterns and drivers in viral community diversity were established for both macrodiversity (inter-population diversity) and microdiversity (intra-population genetic variation). These patterns sometimes, but not always, paralleled those from macro-organisms and revealed temperate and tropical surface waters and the Arctic as biodiversity hotspots and mechanistic hypotheses to explain them.

To address this gap we analyzed public metagenomic datasets from 24 antibiotic treated subjects and controls, combined with an in-depth prospective functional study with two subjects investigating the bacterial community dynamics based on cultivation-dependent and independent methods. We observed that short-term antibiotic treatment shifted and diversified the resistome composition, increased the average copy number of antibiotic resistance genes, and altered the dominant strain genotypes in an individual-specific manner. More than 30% of the resistance genes underwent strong differentiation at the single nucleotide level during antibiotic treatment. We found that the increased potential for horizontal gene transfer, due to antibiotic administration, was ∼3-fold stronger in the differentiated resistance genes than the non-differentiated ones.

However, the high complexity of soil metagenomes, which can contain thousands of bacterial species per gram of soil, imposes significant challenges to explore secondary metabolites potentially produced by rare members of the soil microbiome. Here, we develop a targeted sequencing workflow termed CONKAT-seq (co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences) that detects physically clustered biosynthetic domains, a hallmark of bacterial secondary metabolism. Following targeted amplification of conserved biosynthetic domains in a highly partitioned metagenomic library, CONKAT-seq evaluates amplicon co-occurrence patterns across library subpools to identify chromosomally clustered domains. We show that a single soil sample can contain more than a thousand uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which originate from low frequency genomes which are practically inaccessible through untargeted sequencing. CONKAT-seq allows scalable exploration of largely untapped biosynthetic diversity across multiple soils, and can guide the discovery of novel secondary metabolites from rare members of the soil microbiome.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

The evidence on the interaction between gut microbiota, MC and susceptibility to FA is contradictory.

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that commensal bacteria are essential for MC migration to the gut and their maturation impacting the susceptibility to FA.

Methods: The development and severity of FA symptoms was studied in sensitized germ-free (GF), conventional (CV), and mice mono-colonized with L. plantarum WCFS1 or co-housed with CV mice. MC were phenotypically and functionally characterized.

Results: Systemic sensitization and oral challenge of GF mice with ovalbumin led to increased levels of specific IgE in serum compared to CV mice. Remarkably, despite the high levels of sensitization, GF mice did not develop diarrhea or anaphylactic hypothermia, common symptoms of FA. In the gut, GF mice expressed low levels of the MC tissue-homing markers CXCL1 and CXCL2, and harbored fewer MC which exhibited lower levels of MC protease-1 after challenge. Additionally, MC in GF mice were less mature as confirmed by flow-cytometry and their functionality was impaired as shown by reduced edema formation after injection of degranulation-provoking compound 48/80. Co-housing of GF mice with CV mice fully restored their susceptibility to develop FA. However, this did not occur when mice were mono-colonized with L. plantarum.

Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that microbiota-induced maturation and gut-homing of MC is a critical step for the development of symptoms of experimental FA. This new mechanistic insight into microbiota-MC-FA axis can be exploited in the prevention and treatment of FA in humans.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,

The relative abundance of bacterial families shifted, with increased Planococcaceae and decreased Moraxellaceae, Tissierellaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae in GPA and RA. Further, decreased abundance of Corynebacteriaceae, and Aerococcaceae was observed in GPA samples. Significantly more colonization of S. aureus was seen in the nasal microbiome of GPA compared with RA and healthy control samples. H. influenzae colonization was also observed in GPA samples.

The composition of the healthy human adult gut microbiome is relatively stable over prolonged periods, and representatives of the most highly abundant and prevalent species have been cultured and described. However, microbial abundances can change on perturbations, such as antibiotics intake, enabling the identification and characterisation of otherwise low abundant species.

Design

Analysing gut microbial time-series data, we used shotgun metagenomics to create strain level taxonomic and functional profiles. Community dynamics were modelled postintervention with a focus on conditionally rare taxa and previously unknown bacteria.

Results

In response to a commonly prescribed cephalosporin (ceftriaxone), we observe a strong compositional shift in one subject, in which a previously unknown species, U Borkfalki ceftriaxensis, was identified, blooming to 92% relative abundance. The genome assembly reveals that this species (1) belongs to a so far undescribed order of Firmicutes, (2) is ubiquitously present at low abundances in at least one third of adults, (3) is opportunistically growing, being ecologically similar to typical probiotic species and (4) is stably associated to healthy hosts as determined by single nucleotide variation analysis. It was the first coloniser after the antibiotic intervention that led to a long-lasting microbial community shift and likely permanent loss of nine commensals.

Conclusion

The bloom of U B. ceftriaxensis and a subsequent one of Parabacteroides distasonis demonstrate the existence of monodominance community states in the gut. Our study points to an undiscovered wealth of low abundant but common taxa in the human gut and calls for more highly resolved longitudinal studies, in particular on ecosystem perturbations.",,Metagenomic,Suraj Patel,
